  Developer Tests Using Rational Test RealTime</rpw> </h2>


<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This tool mentor describes how to execute a test campaign created with Rational Test RealTime.</p>
<p>This activity consists in building and executing the test campaign. Test RealTime 
  automatically compiles and runs the test application from the implemented test 
  components.</p>

</ul>
<br>
   
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Every organizational entity (referred to as a &quot;node&quot;) supported by 
  Test RealTime can be built and executed as if it were a single test.</p>
<p>At the highest level, Rational Test RealTime supports the notion of a project. 
  A project is not wedded to any particular notion - that is, the project can 
  be put to use at the user's discretion. Projects can be linked to other projects, 
  forming logically nested sub-projects.</p>
<p>At the next level of detail is the Group node. This is an optional type of 
  node that can be used to group related child nodes (discussed in a moment). 
  The Group node, when built and executed, causes each associated child node to 
  be sequentially built and executed.</p>
<p>Within Project or Group nodes, a developer creates Application and Test nodes. 
  These are the nodes that perform the actual work. An Application node is a node 
  designed simply for the acquisition of runtime analysis information - that is, 
  no Test RealTime tests are executed as part of an Application node. A Test node 
  can be a component test for C, C++, Ada or Java or a system test for C.</p>
<p>The code harness - that is, the code required to enable execution of an Application 
  or Test node on the intended embedded target - is the responsibility of the 
  selected Target Deployment Port (TDP) and is independent of the Test node. However, 
  the Configuration Settings for an Application or Test node can be used to modify 
  certain settings pertaining to the TDP. For more information, see the Tool Mentor 
  &quot;Configuring the Test Environment in Rational Test RealTime&quot;.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a third type of node does exist - referred to as an 
  External Command. This node is used to launch executables that might be required 
  for your test or runtime analysis efforts. Uses might include running external 
  tests or running simulators</p>

<h4>Types of Reports</h4>
<p>To execute any node within Rational Test RealTime, the developer can use one 
  of two methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ExecutionViaGUI">Executing a Rational Test RealTime 
    node using the GUI</a></li>
  <li><a href="#ExecutionViaCMD">Executing a Rational Test RealTime 
    node using the Command Line</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>1. <a name="ExecutionViaGUI">Executing a Rational Test RealTime 
    node using the GUI</a> <font size="3"><b><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></b></font>
</h3>
<p>All nodes are located on the Project Browser tab of the Project Window located, 
  by default, on the right-hand side of the GUI.</p>
<p>The right-click menu of a Project, Group, Application and Test node lets the 
  user Build, Rebuild, Clean and Execute that node. Each has a default definition:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Build: Recompile only those files who time stamp is later than preexisting 
    object code, link all code, execute the resulting executable and then generate 
    the applicable runtime analysis/test reports
  <li> Rebuild: Recompile all source files, link all code, execute the resulting 
    executable and then generate the applicable runtime analysis/test reports
  <li> Clean: Remove all object code and executables
  <li>Execute: Run the preexisting executable:
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Various methods exist for altering the default behavior of Build, Rebuild, 
  Clean and Execute.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the menu item Build-&gt;Options.<br>
    The user can select or deselect those phases of the Build process that should 
    and should not occur. This also gives the user a quick method for shutting 
    off some or all of the runtime analysis features.</li>
  <li>Right-clicking a node and select Properties.<br>
    This brings up a window that can be used to exclude that node from the build 
    process. Thus, if one of ten child Test nodes of a Group node is excluded 
    from the build process, then Building the Group node would result in the build 
    and execution of nine Test nodes.<br>
    This right-click menu also enables the execution of a node in the background. 
    This setting is typically used with External Commands that may precede other 
    nodes in the build chain. Since the build process also works sequentially, 
    from the top to the bottom of the Project Browser, running an External Command 
    in the background prevents subsequent Test, Application and External Command 
    nodes from having to wait for its completion<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Once a node has been built and run, all resulting reports can then be reviewed.</p>

  Mentor: Analyzing Test Results Using Rational Test RealTime</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" height="16" src="../../images/book.gif" width="16"> For detailed 
  information refer to the <i>Rational Test RealTime User Guide</i>, the chapter 
  Graphical User Interface-&gt;Working with Projects.</p>



<h3>2. <a name="ExecutionViaCMD">Executing a Rational Test RealTime node using 
  the Command Line</a> <font size="3"> <b> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></b></font></h3>
<p>The simplest approach to executing a Rational Test RealTime node from the command 
  line assumes that all configuration settings are set using the GUI, ensuring 
  that the only phase left to perform is executing the node of interest. Under 
  these circumstances, the syntax for running a node from the command line is:</p>
  
<blockquote><code>studio -r [node.node.node.&lt;&#133;.&gt;node] &lt;project file&gt;</code></blockquote>
  
<p> In this case, each child node of the project, include sub-projects., can be 
  specified using a &quot;dot&quot; notation - that is, separating the name of 
  each child node from its parent using a period. The project file must always 
  be listed; if listed by itself, without any child node listed, then the entire 
  project is built.</p>
<p>When not using the <code><b>studio</b></code> command to execute a node, the 
  user must create source files that can execute Test RealTime tests or acquire 
  runtime analysis data without conflicting with the user's native compiler and 
  linker. In both cases - that is, regardless of whether the user is attempting 
  to execute a Test or Application node - the user's native compiler and linker 
  do the true work. (In fact, all build activities performed by Test RealTime 
  are simply command line activities triggered from the GUI.)</p>
<p>For Test nodes, the following commands convert Test RealTime test scripts into 
  source files supported by the user's native compiler and linker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for the C language: <code>attolpreproC</code></li>
  <li>for the C++ language: <code>atoprepro</code></li>
  <li>for the Ada language: <code>attolpreproADA</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Java does not require a special command because the test scripts are already 
  .java files</p>
<p>For runtime analysis, the primary choice is whether or not the user wishes 
  to perform source code insertion as an independent activity or as part of the 
  compilation and linkage process. (Of course, if no runtime analysis is required, 
  source code insertion is unnecessary and should not be performed.) To simply 
  perform source code insertion, use the binaries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for the C language: <code>attolcc1</code></li>
  <li>for the C++ language: <code>attolccp</code></li>
  <li>for the Ada language: <code>attolada</code></li>
  <li>for the Java language: <code>javi</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the user would like compilation and linkage to immediately follow 
  source code insertion, use the binaries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for the C and C++ languages: <code>attolcc</code></li>
  <li>for the Java language for standard compilation: <code>javi</code><br>
    inclusion of the javic.jar library, and calls to javic.jar classes, as part 
    of an ant-facilitated build process</li>
</ul>

  Command Line Reference, and in the <i>Rational Test RealTime Reference Guide</i>,

  Analysis</p>
