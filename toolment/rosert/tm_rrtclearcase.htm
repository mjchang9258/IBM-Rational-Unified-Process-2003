<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Rational ClearCase uses a view model combined with a virtual file system that 
  allows you to specify the lineup of file versions with which you want to work. 
  Rational Rose RealTime then sees the files in the current view just as if they 
  were stored on a regular (non-ClearCase) file system. Rose RealTime specifies 
  the set of files that make up the model, and ClearCase provides the versions 
  of these files determined by the view's configuration specification.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/book.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;For detailed information 
  on using Rose RealTime with ClearCase, see the document titled <i>Guide to 
  Team Development, Rational Rose RealTime</i>.</p>
<p>Before using ClearCase, you need to set up your workstation and any workstations 
  on which ClearCase will be used.</p>


<h4>Prerequisite: Setting up ClearCase</h4>

<h5>General Recommendations</h5>
<p>If you are a Microsoft Windows NT user, do not access views through the MVFS 
  mount point or M: drive. Instead, use the views through explicit drive mountings, 
  such as X:, Y:, or Z:. This improves wink-in and eliminates dependencies on 
  view names.</p>

<h5>UCM Integration</h5>
<p>The UCM Integration lets you assign activities to revisions from within the 
  toolsets, if you are working in a UCM VOB. Additionally, you can Rebase, Deliver, 
  and launch the Project Explorer from within Rose RealTime.</p>

<h5>Snapshot Views</h5>
<p>With ClearCase, you can initiate a snapshot view update from within Rose RealTime. 
  The snapshot view contains the directory tree of source files.</p>
<p>You will want to use snapshot views if any of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your computer does not support dynamic views.</li>
  <li>You want to optimize build performance to achieve native build speeds.</li>
  <li>You want to work with source files under ClearCase control when you are 
    either disconnected from the network that hosts the VOBs, or connected to 
    the network intermittently.</li>
  <li>You want access to a view from a computer that is not a ClearCase host.</li>
  <li>Your project does not use ClearCase build auditing and build avoidance.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Rational ClearCase Workstation Setup</h5>
<p>All workstations that will be accessing a VOB or view, must be set up to use 
  ClearCase. For Windows NT/2000, this includes all workstations used for development. 
  For UNIX, this includes all machines that are view servers.</p>
<p>Additionally, all machines that act as view servers for the ClearCase views 
  used by Rose RealTime, must be set up for ClearCase. If you use ClearCase MultiSite, 
  you will need to do this at all the sites where the VOBs containing the Rose 
  elements are replicated. You can determine which machines are view servers by 
  typing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cleartool lsview</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>in a command window. The second item on each output line indicates the machine 
  name where the view server is running. For example, if you see the following 
  line in the output of the lsview command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>myview \\mymachine\vws\myview.vws</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>then &quot;mymachine&quot; is the name of the machine where the view server 
  for myview exists.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/book.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;For further details, 
  see your ClearCase administrator or see the information on source control tools 
  in the <i>Guide to Team Development, Rational Rose RealTime</i>.</p>

<h5>Initial Setup</h5>
<p>The following steps apply if you will be working on a model that is already 
  under source control in a VOB. For additional information, see the information 
  on source control administration in the <i>Guide to Team Development, Rational 
  Rose RealTime</i>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the integrator view so that the configuration specification appears 
    as follows:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><b>element * CHECKEDOUT</b><br><b>element * /main/LATEST</b></pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Create project labels to define various lineups. Examples of significant 
    labels are:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>TC_BASELINE_0 &#151 to represent the initial state of the project</li>
    <li>TC_BUILDFILES &#151 to indicate which element versions should be included 
      in the next automated build</li>
    <li>TC_LATEST_STABLE &#151 to identify the most recent stable lineup on the 
      integration branch</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Create the initial lineup and apply the label to the VOB. An example of 
    an initial lineup is:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
<pre><b>[x:\dev]cleartool mklabel -recurse TC_BASELINE_0 \dev</b></pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Create the developer view template to ensure that all config specs are derived 
    from a common base. This provides consistent and controlled access to the 
    model, and eases the usage of lineups and private branches.<br>
    <br>
    There are two primary functions that developers will be performing; browsing 
    and development. Each requires a different config spec.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../images/book.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;For information 
  on the template rules, see the initial setup information in the <i> Guide to 
  Team Development, Rational Rose RealTime</i>.</p>

<h3>1. <a name="Control appropriate model elements as units">Control appropriate 
  model elements as units</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Determine the granularity you require for your project and team environment 
  at the current stage in development. Do this in collaboration with the architect 
  for the project.</p>


<h3>2. <a name="Create a local work area">Create a local work area</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You will want to establish a local work area to save models in ClearCase. Each 
  developer accessing Rose RealTime files in a VOB should use their own dedicated 
  view.</p>


<h3>3. <a name="Save a model to the work area">Save a model to the work area</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Before placing the model under source control, it must be saved to the local 
  work area. Save the model to the directory you have associated with your source 
  control repository.</p>


<h3>4. <a name="Configure the workspace source control options">Configure the 
  workspace source control options</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To enable source control, fill in the appropriate settings described in the 
  source control fundamentals in the <i> Guide to Team Development, Rational Rose 
  RealTime</i>.</p>


<h3>5. <a name="Add the model to source control">Add the model to source control</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The simplest way to add all applicable units to source control is to use the 
  <b>Submit All Changes to Source Control</b> tool. See the source control administration 
  information in the <i>Guide to Team Development, Rational Rose RealTime</i> 
  for more information.</p> 


<h3>6. <a name="Make the default workspace available to project members">Make 
  the default workspace available to project members</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The workspace (.rtwks) file contains information that is common to all users 
  working on the project. Settings in the workspace will rarely, if ever, change 
  after it is initially set up. All developers on a project should use identical 
  copies of the workspace file. For this reason, you may want to place this file 
  under source control so that a fixed version is available to all project users. 
  Rational Rose RealTime does not provide explicit support for checking in or 
  checking out this file.</p>
<p>After the source control manager adds the model to source control, the workspace 
  should be manually added using your source control tool. Other users should 
  then retrieve the workspace as part of their initial update of their local work 
  area. This ensures that all team members use the same source control settings 
  for the project.</p>


<h3>7. <a name="Use view templates">Use view templates</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>View templates are used to ensure that developers use a common base for their 
  view’s config spec and to make it easier to work on private branches. A view 
  template specifies the integration branch to work from, lists labeled checkpoints 
  that can be used to base a private branch on, and includes a config spec template 
  that can be filled in with additional config spec rules.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/book.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;See the Rational 
  ClearCase parallel development information in the <i> Guide to Team Development, 
  Rational Rose RealTime</i> for more information.</p>


<h3>8. <a name="ClearCase entities">ClearCase entities</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Views, view templates, and labels can be created to help facilitate Rational 
  ClearCase features. See the ClearCase parallel development information in the 
  <i>Guide to Team Development, Rational Rose RealTime</i> for more information.</p>


<h3>9. <a name="Automate builds">Automate builds</a> <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>To provide the ability to selectively choose the versions of files that go 
  into the build, the builder selects all versions that are labeled with the build 
  label TC_BUILDFILES. This allows flexibility in changing the exact versions 
  that go into the build if needed. For example, if the most recent version of 
  a file contains code that does not compile, then the previous version can be 
  labeled instead.</p>
<p>The following steps are involved in the build:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Label the build files.</li>
  <li>Perform the build.</li>
  <li>When the build completes successfully:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new lineup label and apply to build file versions.</li>
    <li>Apply TC_LATEST_STABLE to build file versions.</li>
    <li>Make the new lineup available to developers.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>


<h3>10. <a name="Developer process">Developer process</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>
<p>Each development activity is completed by a single developer and is performed 
  on a private branch specific to that activity. Again, each developer requires 
  his or her own view. The view is based on a branching point on the integration 
  branch identified by a build label.<br>
  <br>
  A unique branch name must be chosen that identifies the work being performed, 
  such as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>paulz_timing</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The view’s config spec rules are set up to automatically check out and branch 
  files from the branching point to the private branch. As well, new elements 
  created during the development activity are immediately branched to the private 
  branch.</p> 
<p>Because the branch is hidden from other developers, the user may check in incremental 
  changes to the branch. When the developer is satisfied that his or her changes 
  are completed and ready to be integrated, the developer informs the integrator 
  that all changes on the private branch are ready for integration.</p> 
<p>By basing developer private branches off of labels that correspond to the versions 
  used by automated builds, each developer will be able to reuse most of the build 
  results in the form of winked-in derived objects. This significantly reduces 
  the amount of building that is required by each developer when changes are made.</p>

<h3>11. <a name="Integration Process">Integration Process</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>Each development activity must eventually be merged into the integration branch. 
  ClearCase has several tools available for performing such a merge. The <b>cleartool 
  findmerge</b> command can be used to merge all changes from a branch onto another 
  branch. From the integrator view, the following command syntax can be used:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cleartool findmerge \dev -all -fversion .../paulz_timing/LATEST -merge</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternately, Windows NT users can use the ClearCase Merge Manager to perform 
  the same merge.</p>
  
<p>Both of these methods will merge directory versions and also use Rose RealTime 
  Model Integrator to merge changes in model files. After performing the merge, 
  the integrator should load the model into Rose RealTime and verify that no merge 
  errors have occurred. If the model loads correctly, the changes should be checked 
  in using the <b>Tools &#151;&gt; Source Control &#151;&gt; Submit All Changes 
  to Source Control</b> menu item.<br>
</p>
<p>To integrate a series of development activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load the model from the integrator's view.</li>
  <li>Perform the merge as detailed above.</li>
  <li>Use <b>Tools &#151;&gt; Source Control &#151;&gt; Synchronize Entire Model</b>. 
    This will reload all files that have changed in the merge.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the merged differences are valid.</li>
  <li>Use <b>Tools &#151;&gt; Source Control &#151;&gt; Submit All Changes to 
    Source Control</b> to accept the changes and check them into source control.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each activity that needs integration.</li>
</ol>
