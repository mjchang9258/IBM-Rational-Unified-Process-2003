The following listed files are COPIES of the original source files in the xde_eclipse directory.
Copies are used because it is easier to maintain the small amount tagged text that distinguishes the two tools, than to maintain two complete different sets of source files.

tm_*.htm
online_help_link.js
model_structure_guidelines.htm
images folder and contents

Note that the file online_help_link_vsnet.js is not used.  If used to replace online_help _link.js, it changes the online help references into links into VS.NET online help - links which can be used to aid in testing.
