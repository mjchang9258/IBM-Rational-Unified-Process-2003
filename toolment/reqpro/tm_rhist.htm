</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This tool mentor explains how to view the history of a requirement in Rational 
  RequisitePro&reg;.</p>
<p>This section provides links to additional information related to this tool mentor.<br>
  <ul>
<li><a href="../../process/activity/ac_ckino.htm">Make Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="../../process/activity/ac_rvucm.htm">Review Requirements</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
  <br>
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As requirements are modified, the requirement history allows you to keep track 
  of the <b>what</b>, <b>when</b>, <b>why</b>, and <b>who</b> of these requirement 
  changes. Requirement history provides the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How often do your requirements change? (Too much change too quickly may 
    be indicative of an ill-defined requirement.)</li>
  <li>Who modified a particular requirement? (You may want to consult that person 
    and understand his or her motives before validating or invalidating that change.)</li>
  <li>Why has a requirement changed? (What is the rationale?)</li>
  <li>What caused a relationship between two requirements to become &quot;suspect&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the history of a requirement is particularly useful during impact analysis, 
  when you are trying to determine whether a change to one requirement affects 
  requirements to which it is linked.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. <a name="ViewHistory">View the history of a requirement</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In RequisitePro, the history of a requirement is located in the <b>Revision</b> 
  tab of the Requirement Properties <b> </b>dialog box. This dialog box is accessible 
  from either the Microsoft&reg; Word document or a view.</p>
<p>In the Word document:
<ol>
  <li>Position your cursor in the text of a
    requirement.</li>
    <li>Click <b>RequisitePro</b> &gt; <b>Requirement</b>
      &gt; <b>Properties</b>. The Requirement Properties dialog box
      appears.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a view:
<ol>
  <li>Select the requirement row and do one of the following to open the
    Requirement Properties dialog box:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Right-click to display the
    context-sensitive menu, and then click <b>Properties</b> from the pop-up
      menu.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Requirement &gt; Properties</b>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/reqprops.gif" width="497" height="291" border="0" alt=""></p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Click the <b>Revision</b> tab. This pane displays the last
        change made to that requirement. The date, time, author, and change
        description (rationale for the change) are shown.
      <li>Click the <b>History</b> button. The Revision History dialog box
        displays all modifications made to that requirement since it was
        created. RequisitePro automatically increases the Revision number as
        modifications occur.</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center">
    <img src="images/reqrevhist.gif" width="428" height="275"><br>
    <ul><br>
      <li>Click a revision in the revisions list box to view details about that
        revision.
      <li>Click <b>Print</b> to print the set of revisions for that requirement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b>  To print revisions pertaining to multiple
requirements, use Rational SoDA&reg;, the Rational document automation tool, to
extract any set of revisions from the RequisitePro project and print a
Word or Adobe&reg; FrameMaker document. Alternatively, open the read-only
RequisitePro database with an ODBC connection and use a database reporting tool to
query revisions on multiple requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2.&nbsp; <a name="ImpactAnalysis">Perform an impact analysis</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Reviewing the history of a requirement is an important step in impact
analysis. One of the reasons you set traceability links between requirements is
to have a means of flagging requirements that might be affected by a change in a
related requirement.</p>
<p>RequisitePro uses a <b>suspect link</b> to denote that the relationship
between two related requirements must be reexamined because one of the
requirements has been modified. A suspect link is visually represented in a
Traceability Matrix or a Traceability Tree with a red slash through a
traceability arrow. This indicator visually notifies users that the text or
attributes of a requirement have changed and that this change may affect
requirements that are traced to or from the modified requirement.</p>
<p>When a suspect link is displayed, you investigate what caused the suspect
link and what effects the change might have on other requirements. You view the
history of the two requirements involved in the suspect link, following the
steps outlined in the first section of this tool mentor (<a href="#ViewHistory">View
the history of a requirement</a>). When you view the history of the modified
requirement, you may reach one of the following two conclusions:
<ul>
  <li>The modification to that requirement does not affect the linked
    requirements. In this case, the suspect link can be cleared. To clear a
    suspect link while you are in a traceability view, position your cursor on
    the suspect link icon. Right-click to display the context-sensitive menu,
    and select <b>Clear Suspect</b>.
  <li>The modification affects the linked requirements. In this case, the
    definition of the linked requirements must be updated to reflect the change
    before the link is cleared.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clear a suspect link while you are in a traceability view, double-click
the requirement that is affected. Then do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the requirement was created in a RequisitePro document, RequisitePro
    opens the document and positions the cursor on the requirement. Modify the
    text of the requirement as necessary in light of the related modified
    requirement, and then click <b>RequisitePro &gt; Document &gt; Save</b> to
    commit your changes.
  <li>If the requirement was created directly in a view, the Requirement
    Properties dialog box appears. Modify the <b>Text</b> box, and click <b>OK</b>
    to commit your change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <a name="Tips">Record the history of requirements</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The following tips are related to the use of requirements history.
<ul>
  <li><b>Tip 1</b>: <a href="#tip1">Assign user names to all users</a></li>
  <li><b>Tip 2</b>: <a href="#tip2">Do not delete requirements</a></li>
  <li><b>Tip 3</b>: <a href="#tip3">Add revisions to traceability relationships</a></li>
  <li><b>Tip 4</b>: <a href="#tip4">Always fill in change notification dialogs</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Tip 1: <a name="tip1">Assign user names to all users</a></h4>
<p>An important record in the requirement history is the author of the
requirement change. This author is the user logged into the RequisitePro project
at the time the requirement is modified. To record which user logs in,
you must enable the RequisitePro project security.</p>
<p>By default, RequisitePro projects have security disabled. Even if you do not
want to set permissions for each project components (project, documents,
requirements, and so on), you should enable security so that you can assign user names to users.
These user names will be entered in the requirement revisions as a user creates
or modifies a requirement.</p>
<p>To enable security and create user names, do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Click <b>File &gt; Project Administration &gt; Security</b>. The Project
    Security dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Select the <b>Enable security for this project</b> check box.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create user groups:
<ol>
  <li>Click on the <b>Add</b> button located below the <b>Groups</b> box. The Group Permissions dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Type a group name and define permissions for that group. Permissions can
    be set for specific document types, requirement types, attributes, and
    attribute values. You can also define whether this group of users can modify
    the project structure. This can include permission to add attributes to
    requirement types, add document types, and so forth.</li>
</ol>
<p align="center"><img src="images/image65.gif" width="347" height="400" border="0" alt=""></p>
<p align="left">To add an individual user:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a group in the Groups list in the Project Security dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Add </b>button located in the <b>Users of Group</b> box.
    The Add User dialog box appears.</li>
  <li>Enter a username  (for example, John Smith); you have the option of
    typing a password and e-mail address. E-mail
    addresses are used when users participate in e-mail group
    discussions.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tip 2: <a name="tip2">Do not delete requirements</a></h4>
<p>RequisitePro allows you to delete requirements. This feature is useful when
you first create a project; you may want to experiment with how to use
RequisitePro and what level of detail you want to use for requirements. At some
point, you decide that your project is ready to be maintained as it is. From
that point on, you should keep track of every modification made in the project.
Be aware that when RequisitePro deletes requirements, every property of that
requirement is deleted, including its history; this is typically
information you do not want to lose. RequisitePro requires your confirmation
before deleting the requirement.</p>
<p>We recommend that you not delete a requirement using the <b>Delete</b> feature.
Instead, you can create an attribute (for example, Deleted or Inactive) to mark
requirements as &quot;deleted&quot; (or inactive). You can re-activate that
requirement later by simply changing the value of that attribute.</p>
<p>You might also want to relocate inactive requirements either to the bottom of
the document in which they appear or to the database (so that inactive
requirements do not appear in documents). To move requirements that are located
in the Word document (as opposed to those that are located only in a view), follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Word document, position your cursor in the requirement text.
  <li>Click <b>RequisitePro &gt; Requirement &gt; Cut</b>.
  <li>In the Explorer, click the Attribute Matrix in which you want to paste the
    requirements, and then click <b>Edit &gt; Paste</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tip 3: <a name="tip3">Add revisions to traceability relationships</a></h4>
<p>By default, RequisitePro maintains revisions of requirements, not traceability
links. To set RequisitePro to also maintain revisions of traceability links, do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Click <b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Options</b>.
  <li>In the Traceability section, select the check box <b>Changes
    logged in history</b>.
  <li>Click <b>OK</b>.
</ol>
<p>To verify the traceability history log, open a Traceability Matrix. Add or 
  remove a traceability link between two requirements. Then select one of the 
  requirements and click <b>Requirements &gt; Properties</b> to open the Requirement 
  dialog box. At the <b>Revision</b> tab, click <b>History</b>. The traceability 
  change appears in the Revision list.</p>
<h4>Tip 4: <a name="tip4">Always fill in change notification dialogs</a></h4>
<p>As part of good requirement management process, we recommend that project members 
  record their reasons for changing requirements. RequisitePro provides a <b>Change 
  Description</b> field in which this information can be recorded.</p>
<p>The <b>Change Description</b> field is located on the <b>Revision</b> tab 
  of the Requirement Properties dialog box.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/image67.gif" width="428" height="275"></p>
<p>When you save a RequisitePro document containing requirements that have been 
  modified, RequisitePro displays the Change Notification dialog box for each 
  modified requirement. You can use the <b>Apply to all modified requirements 
  in the document</b> check box to attach the same Change Description information 
  to all modified requirements (for example, &quot;per meeting with VP on 5/30/2001&quot;).</p>
