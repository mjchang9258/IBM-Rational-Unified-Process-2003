<p>The Rational XDE&#153; software tool includes features that allow the application
  designers and database designers to develop the application and the database
  using the same tool. As a <u> <a href="../../process/workers/wk_dbdsr.htm">database
  designer</a></u> or <u><a href="../../process/workers/wk_dsgnr.htm">designer</a></u>,
  you can use XDE to model and design databases, as well as to integrate your
  application and database.&nbsp;The XDE Data Modeler uses the Unified Modeling
  Language (UML) Profile for Database Modeling as the standard notation for constructing
  Data Models.&nbsp;The following XDE online Help topics provide key background
  information on specific details related to database modeling and development
  using Rational XDE:</p>

<ul>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Databases Supported in Rational XDE","dm","dm_r_db_support");</script>:  Lists the databases supported in Rational XDE.</li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Supported OLE DB Providers and JDBC Drivers","dm","dm_r_support_ole_db_jdbc");</script>:  Lists data access providers and drivers supported in Rational XDE.</li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Setting Options for Data Models","dm","dm_o_mdl_data_pref");</script>:  Summarizes setting the default database assignment and database target.</li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Setting the Default Database Assignment","dm","dm_t_set_default_db_assign");</script>
    : Provides guidance for configuring XDE Data Models to point toward a specifically
    named database.</li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("UML Data Modeling Profile","dm","dm_r_uml_dm_profile");</script>
    : Summarizes the Unified Modeling Language (UML) modeling elements used in
    the Data Model.</li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Data Modeling Visibility Icons","dm","dm_r_visible_icon");</script>
    : Lists notational elements for defining primary/foreign keys and database
    triggers specific to a Data Model. </li>
 </ul>
<p>There are three ways to begin a <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_datmd.htm">Data
  Model</a> in XDE:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Build the Data Model directly in XDE using the Data Modeler tools. </li>
  <li>Transform persistent classes in the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_desmd.htm">Design
    Model</a> to create tables in the Data Model.</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer an existing database schema or DDL script to create a Data
    Model.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the different methods for creating the Data Model,
  refer to the following XDE Help topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Designing Data Models","dm","dm_o_bld_dm");</script></li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Class to Table Transformation","dm","dm_c_clss_tbl_transf");</script></li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">[this topic has been removed and is covered by the getting started
    section written by Amber, gs_t_creating projects.htm</font> <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Data Modeling Projects","dm","dm_t_dm_project");</script></li>
  <li><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Building Data Models by Reverse Engineering","dm","dm_o_gen_dm_re");</script></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining sections of this tool mentor provide instructions on how to build 
  a Data Model by transforming persistent classes in the Design Model to develop 
  it. The Data Model package structure that is discussed here is described in 
  more detail in the Data Model section of <a href="model_structure_guidelines.htm">XDE 
  Model Structure Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p> <a href="tm_db_rev.htm">Tool Mentor: Reverse Engineering Databases Using Rational
  XDE</a> provides more information on how to create a Data Model by reverse engineering
  the physical database design. </p>

<h3><a name="Develop Logical Data Model">Develop Logical Data Model &lt;optional&gt;</a>
  <a href="#Top"> <img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Some projects might need to create a idealized &quot;logical&quot; model of
  the database design that captures an application-independent view of the key
  logical data entities and their relationships.&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> [Comment: Logical Data Modeling has been separated as its own model,
   I don't know how RUP documents it, but I have several topics covering the
area. Because the models are separate you transform a&nbsp; Logical data model
to a data model to generate tables from classes. Also includes support of
candidate and surrogate keys.]</font><a href="model_structure_guidelines.htm"></a>
 This Logical Data Model
  can be thought of as an &quot;analysis&quot; type of model similar to the optional
  <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_amdl.htm">Artifact: Analysis Model</a> that
  might be used in the development of the application design.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should
  be noted that the Logical Data Model is included in the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_datmd.htm">Artifact:
  Data Model</a> and is not considered to be a separate RUP artifact.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The Logical Data Model can be created directly using XDE Data Modeler tools.&nbsp;See
  the <a href="model_structure_guidelines.htm">XDE Model Structure Guidelines</a>
  for information on creating a Logical Data Model within the overall Data Model
  artifact.&nbsp;Refer to the
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Logical Data Models","dm","dm_c_logical_dm");</script>
  topic in the Rational XDE online Help for more information on developing the
  logical database design. </p>



<h3><a name="Develop Physical Data Model">Develop Physical Database Design</a>
  <a href="#Top"> <img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>You can refine the Logical Data Model to create a detailed model of the physical
  database design using Rational XDE. <br>
  (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Physical Data Models","dm","dm_c_phys_dm");</script>
  .) This detailed Physical Data Model might then be forward engineered to create
  a database. (See <a href="tm_db_forw.htm">Tool Mentor: Forward Engineering Databases
  in Rational XDE</a>.)&nbsp; The major steps in developing a Physical Data Model
  are described below.</p>

<h4><a name="Define Domains">Define Domains</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Create domains to implement user-defined data types that can be used throughout
  the Data Model to enforce database design standards. (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Domains","dm","dm_c_dom");</script>
  .)&nbsp; Domains can also be used to embed business rules in columns.</p>
<p> In order to use the data types defined by the domains in the Data Model, you
  must follow these guidelines:</p>


<ul>
  <li>Domains must be defined in a separate package within the Data Model. <font color="#FF0000"> [Comment:
    Under best practices for source control we also encouraged users of large
    teams to create a separate model for domains, in fact we have domain model
    templates for each DBMS]</font> (See
    <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Domains","dm","dm_t_create_dom");</script>
    .)</li>
  <li>The package containing the domains must be assigned to the database component
    that realizes the tables in the database. (See
    <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Assigning Domain Packages to Databases","dm","dm_t_assign_dom_pkg_db");</script>
    .) </li>
</ul>
<p> For information on how to apply a domain to a column in the Data Model, see
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Assigning Domains to Columns","dm","dm_t_assign_dom_col");</script>
  .&nbsp; </p>


<h4><a name="Transform Logical Database Design into Physical Database Design">
Create Initial Physical Database Design Elements</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Transform persistent classes in the Design Model into tables within it. (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Class to Table Transformation","dm","dm_c_clss_tbl_transf");</script>
  .)&nbsp; The attributes of the classes become columns in the tables.&nbsp;Rational
  XDE provides the option of defining attributes of the classes as candidate keys.
  (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Assigning Candidate Keys","dm","dm_t_assign_cand_key");</script>
  .) Rational XDE also converts specific associations between the classes to relationships
  between the tables. The following Rational XDE online Help topics provide more
  information on how the classes are transformed into tables:</p>


<ul type="square">



  <li> General Mapping Information - <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Class to Table Transformation Mapping","dm","dm_r_clsstbl_transf_map");</script></li>
  <li> DBMS Specific Mapping Information - <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Class to Table Transformation Data Type Mapping","dm","dm_o_clss_tbltransf_dtmap");</script>  </li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Define Reference Tables">Define Reference Tables</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Create reference tables as needed for managing any static data items in the
  database.&nbsp;You can create reference tables directly in the Data Model using
  the XDE Data Modeler features. See the
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Tables and Columns","dm","dm_o_mdl_tables_col");</script>
  topic in the Rational XDE online Help for general information about creating
  tables.</p>


<h4><a name="Create Primary Key and Unique Key Constraints">Create Primary Key
and Unique Key Constraints</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Define primary key constraints and unique key constraints to identify rows
  of information in a table. See the online Help topic
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Primary Key Constraints","dm","dm_c_pk_cnstrnt");</script>
  for more information on using primary key constraints.&nbsp; The online Help
  topic&nbsp;
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Primary Key Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_pk_cnstrnt");</script>
  describes the steps used to create a primary key constraint on one or more columns
  of a table.&nbsp; Information on defining unique key constraints is contained
  in
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Unique Key Constraints","dm","dm_c_uk_cnstrnt");</script>
  , and the steps to create a unique key constraint in the model are described
  in
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Unique Key Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_uk_cnstrnt");</script>.</p>

<p>Refer to the topic <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Constraints","dm","dm_o_create_cnstrnt");</script>
in the Rational XDE online Help for additional information.</p>
<h4><a name="Define Data and Referential Integrity Enforecment Rules">Define Data and Referential
Integrity Enforcement Rules</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Check constraints can be used to control updates to data elements in tables.&nbsp;Rational
  XDE provides the ability to define check constraints for tables, columns, and
  domains. See the topic
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Check Constraints","dm","dm_c_ck_cnstrnt");</script>
  in the Rational XDE online Help for a description of check constraints.&nbsp;The
  following XDE online Help topics describe how to create the three types of check
  constraints in the Data Model: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Column Check Constraints - <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Column Check Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_ckcnstrnt_col");</script></li>
  <li>Table Check Constraints - <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Table Check Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_ckcnstrnt_tbl");</script></li>
  <li>Domain Check Constraints - <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Domain Check Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_ckcnstrnt_dom");</script></li>
</ul>
<p>Another type of constraint used to assure referential integrity is the foreign
  key constraint. (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Foreign Key Constraints","dm","dm_c_fk_cnstrnt");</script>
  .)&nbsp; Foreign key constraints can be produced only by creating a relationship
  between tables. (See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Foreign Key Constraints","dm","dm_t_create_fk_cnstrnt");</script>
  .)&nbsp; The exception to this is the process of reverse engineering a database
  or DDL script into a Data Model, in which case the relationships, and therefore
  the foreign keys, are generated automatically.&nbsp;Key migration depends on
  the type of relationship—identifying versus non-identifying—added between two
  tables.</p>
<p>Refer to the topics
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Key Migration","dm","dm_c_key_mig");</script> and <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Changing the Migrated Key","dm","dm_t_chng_mig_key");</script> in the Rational XDE online Help
for further details on how keys are migrated as foreign keys.</p>

<h4><a name="De-Normalize the Database Design to Optimize for Performance">De-Normalize the Database
Design to Optimize  for Performance</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Depending on the specific project situation, you might need to adjust the normalized
  physical database design to meet performance requirements.&nbsp;Optimize the
  Data Model for performance improvement by designing the tables to store objects
  that are retrieved together in the same table.&nbsp;This technique is called
  de-normalization.&nbsp;To de-normalize, combine the unique columns from the
  two tables into one, and remove the second table.&nbsp; </p>
<h4><a name="Optimize Data Access">Optimize Data Access</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An additional optimization technique is to use column indexing to access data
  in tables more efficiently. See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Indexes","dm","dm_c_index");</script>
  for an overview of how to use indexing to improve database performance. See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Indexes","dm","dm_t_create_index");</script>
  for a description of how to create indexes in the Data Model.
<p> Another aspect of data access is in the use of database views.&nbsp;Views
  can be used to control or restrict access to data in one or more tables.&nbsp;See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Views","dm","dm_t_create_view");</script>
  &nbsp;for a description of how to create a view in the Data Model.&nbsp;For
  more information on views, refer to
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Views","dm","dm_o_mdl_view");</script>
  .</p>
<p></p>

<h4><a name="Define Storage Characteristics">Define Storage Characteristics</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Create a model storage design for the database by defining the
tablespaces and tablespace containers. (See
<script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Tablespaces","dm","dm_c_ts_overview");</script>
.) Map the physical database design elements to the storage elements through realization
relationships. The XDE online Help topic
<script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Adding Tablespaces to Databases","dm","dm_t_add_ts_db");</script>
describes how to create tablespaces for a specific database. The XDE online Help
topic
<script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Assigning Tables to Tablespaces","dm","dm_t_assign_tbl_ts");</script>
describes how to assign the tables in the model to the tablespaces.</p>
<p>Rational XDE currently supports modeling tablespaces for Oracle, DB2, and SQL
  Server.&nbsp; The following XDE online Help topics provide guidance on how to
  model tablespaces for these DBMS products:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li> <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Oracle Tablespaces","dm","dm_o_mdl_oracle_ts");</script></li>
  <li> <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling DB2 Tablespaces","dm","dm_o_mdl_db2_ts");</script></li>
  <li> <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling SQL Server Tablespaces","dm","dm_o_mdl_sqlsrv_ts");</script></li>

</ul>
<p> Refer to the following topics in the Rational XDE online Help for more information
  about tablespace and database model elements: </p>

<ul>

  <li>[<font color="#FF0000">Topic name is Modeling Databases and Tablespaces]</font><script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Tablespaces","dm","dm_o_mdl_ts");</script> </li>

<h4><a name="Distribute Class Behavior to the Database">Design Stored Procedures
to Distribute Class Behavior to the Database</a> <a href="#Top">
<img border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Define stored procedures as needed to support efficient storage and retrieval
  of information in the database. Examine the operations of the design classes
  that were used to create the tables for candidate stored procedures.&nbsp;Stored
  procedures can be implemented as procedures or functions.&nbsp;See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Stored Procedures","dm","dm_c_sp");</script>
  for a description of stored procedures. Stored procedures must reside in a Stored
  Procedure Container, as described in
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Stored Procedure Containers","dm","dm_c_sp_cont");</script>
  . Stored procedures are created as operations of the Stored Procedure Container
  class in which they reside. See
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Stored Procedures","dm","dm_t_create_sp");</script>
, <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Stored Procedure Containers","dm","dm_t_create_sp_cont");</script>
  , and
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Creating Stored Procedure Parameters","dm","dm_t_create_sp_prmtr");</script>
  for details on how to create stored procedures using Rational XDE.</p>


<p>For more information on stored procedures, refer to the topic
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Stored Procedures","dm","dm_o_mdl_sp");</script> in the Rational XDE online
Help.</p>


<p>Define triggers as needed to further control and manage modifications to the
  information in the tables. Refer to the topic
  <script language=javascript>ReferenceHelpTopic("Modeling Triggers","dm","dm_o_mdl_trig");</script> in the Rational XDE
online Help for a description of the types of triggers supported in XDE and for
additional topics on how to create triggers in the model. </p>
