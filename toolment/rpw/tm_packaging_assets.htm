</h2>


<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Projects produce a variety of reusable assets that could be applied to subsequent 
  projects, making them more efficient and faster. Examples can range from organization-specific 
  guidance on certain artifacts through example artifacts to full models articulating 
  a key architecture. </p>
<p>The RUP Organizer component of the Rational Process Workbench can be used to 
  package these assets in such a way that they are directly attached to the activities, 
  artifacts and roles that they are relevant to. In this way, future projects 
  that create RUP Configurations will have explicit examples and guidance more 
  directly pertinent to their needs available at their fingertips.</p>
<p>The format for this collection of useful assets is referred to as a thin plug-in. 
  This is the simplest and fastest type of plug-in to create, allowing minimal 
  effort to provide benefit for the most people.</p>

<h3><a name="CollectResources"></a>Collect available resources <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>First collect the assets you think you might want to share. Assets include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guidelines: additional text or diagrams that provide valuable assistance 
    and clarity in creating a particular artifact, including standards, tailoring 
    options and suggestions regarding formality.</li>
  <li>Checkpoints: lists of questions to ask about an artifact to validate its 
    level of maturity and quality.</li>
  <li>Organizational or project standards: explicit requirements that must be 
    met by an artifact due to external constraints, for example code standards.</li>
  <li>Concept page: additional text or diagrams that address an idea or approach 
    at a high-level to provide greater clarity and understanding of the intellectual 
    or practical approach suggested, without explicit process statements. Usually 
    fairly brief html documents that are closely related to a specific activity 
    or workflow.</li>
  <li>White papers: more extensive concept pages, frequently in Word or pdf format, 
    that contain much broader and deeper process guidance.</li>
  <li>Templates: documents or models with organizational structure, descriptive 
    material but no content, ready for use by a project as the basis for an artifact 
    or artifact set.</li>
  <li>Examples: documents or models that have content as well as organizational 
    structure that can either be used to provide greater understanding of the 
    approach to creating an artifact from scratch, or as a pre-filled starting 
    point for further elaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point there is no assumption about the format of this information. 
  It could be emails, databases, documents, spreadsheets or html. Formatting it 
  for effective use within a RUP configuration is another step in the process.</p>
<p>It's very useful to collect these assets in a single file location, separated 
  from material that will not be in the shared asset set. This enables better 
  management of it, and is very useful for later use with RUP Organizer. We refer 
  to a folder with content in it as a content library. RUP Organizer adds other 
  key organizing material to it during creation of the thin plug-in.</p>
<p>This step is done using the normal tools available to you: email, word processor 
  and file explorers.</p>


<h3><a name="CreateNewPlugin"></a>Create a new thin plug-in 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>First, a couple of quick definitions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Process base: this is an existing Modeled Plug-in or the RUP base that your 
    new Thin Plug-in will attach to. It contains the base layout that you can 
    attach your process assets to.</li>
  <li>Layout: this is a hierarchical view of the process definition contained 
    in a plug-in or the RUP base. In a Thin Plug-in, you can attach files to the 
    layout of your process base or create a new folder structure separately from 
    it. This creates an architecturally correct and complementary overlay on top 
    of the existing process that can be added or removed as you need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following steps in RUP Organizer will enable you to create a new thin plug-in 
  for your content and point it at your content library.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Launch RUP Organizer from your Start menu (within Rational Software).<br>
    A dialog box appears with a list of existing plug-ins and process bases and 
    two choices: <i>Create new plug-in layout</i> and <i>Edit existing layout</i>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Choose<font color="#FF0000"> </font><i>Create new plug-in </i>and click 
    OK.<br>
    A dialog box will appear asking for the name of your thin plug-in.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Enter a name for your plug-in.<br>
    The system will ask you for the location of your content library.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Browse to the location of the content library you created above.<br>
    The system will display a list of existing plug-ins and the RUP base to attach 
    your plug-in to.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Select a process base for your plug-in. (Usually this will be the RUP base).<br>
    The main RUP Organizer window will appear with a content explorer for your 
    Thin Plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="LinkProcessElements"></a>Link your assets to process elements <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>The RUP Organizer has two main panels: a Content Explorer and a Layouts panel. 
  The Content Explorer is just like any other file explorer, with a folder structure 
  in the leftmost panel and a file list in the central panel. The Layouts panel 
  has a tree-control for the layouts of the process base and your Thin Plug-in.</p>
<p>Clicking on your content library in the leftmost window will bring up the list 
  of files in the central panel.</p>
<p>To attach an existing process asset to a process element in the process base:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Layouts panel, navigate to the process element you would like to 
    attach something to.</li>
  <li>Select the process asset in the Content Explorer and drag it onto the process 
    element.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new element in the layout, for example a new folder, right-click 
  on the process element you would like to contain the folder and select Create 
  Folder. Give it a name, and then you can add process assets to it.</p>
<p>Process assets that apply to more than one process element can be dragged over 
  all that they apply to. For example, a modeling standard covering both sequence 
  diagrams and class diagrams can be dragged on top of both artifact elements 
  and would show up in both places in a published RUP Configuration containing 
  the Thin Plug-in.</p>
<p>In general, you can attach different type of process assets to different kind 
  of process elements. The list below suggests the typical asset-to-process-element 
  attachment recomendations :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guidelines: primarily to artifacts, secondarily to activities or roles.</li>
  <li>Checkpoints: to artifacts or activities. </li>
  <li>Organizational or project standards: to any applicable element type.</li>
  <li>Concept page: first option is disciplines or workflow details, but artifacts, 
    activities, and roles are candidates too.</li>
  <li>White papers: if narrowly scoped, they can be attached to workflow details 
    or even roles, but often these assets relates to whole disciplines.</li>
  <li>Templates: to artifacts.</li>
  <li>Examples: to artifacts. You might also create a folder of examples to provide 
    a single coherent set of material that travels together, or you can attach 
    examples to the tools that created them. For example, a Rational Rose model 
    that you would like to use could be attached to the Rational Rose tool process 
    element.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ConvertFormat"></a>Optional: Convert to a RUP-like format <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you would like the content to appear in one the standard RUP formats, for 
  example a guideline page, you can instantiate the content pages inside RUP Organizer 
  and author these in your favorite html editor. First, a couple of new concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Organizer Template: all of the standard page types you are used to seeing 
    in published RUP websites have templates associated with them in RUP Organizer. 
    These contain the headings, space for your text and embedded RPW Commands.</li>
  <li>RPW Commands: an RPW command is a text string starting with &quot;!RPW&quot; 
    that RUP Builder knows how to interpret when it publishes a RUP Website. RPW 
    commands allow the dynamic generation of web-pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the process element in the layout for which you would like to create 
    a new page.</li>
  <li>Choose the File &gt; Content File &gt; <i>Filetype, </i>(where <i>Filetype 
    </i>is one of the supported asset types, such as Guideline, Concept, or Whitepaper).</li>
  <li>When the file dialog appears, browse to the location in your content library 
    where you want to store the new file. </li>
  <li>Give your file a useful name, including the .htm extension.</li>
  <li>Enter a presentation name when prompted, this will be the page title in 
    the resulting Website as well as the node name in the tree.<br>
    RUP Organizer will display the file in the selected location in the content 
    library browser.</li>
  <li>Drag it onto the target process element in the base layout.</li>
  <li>Open the process asset in the content library browser by right-clicking 
    on the file entry and selecting Edit (or simply double click)<br>
    RUP Organizer will launch your default html editor with the skeletal file 
    you just created. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Copy the information into the new html file from source (for example a Word 
    document), or type in the content from scratch if no source exists. Be sure 
    to leave the RPW commands untouched, to enable RUP Builder to publish all 
    information related to this content file.</li>
  <li>Save your file.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is now saved in your Thin Plug-in content library and attached to the appropriate 
  process element in the layout.</p>
<h3><a name="ValidatePlugin"></a>Validate Plug-in <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>There are a few steps in validating your Thin Plug-in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm an individual html file is correct: right-click on the process element 
    in the layout and select Preview. This will run the RPW Commands and display 
    the html screen in a browser for you to review.</li>
  <li>Check Files: This command (available from the tool bar or the File menu) 
    will traverse the entire layout, ensuring that all file attachments are correct, 
    that Presentation Names are correct, etc.</li>
  <li>Publish a configuration including the Plug-in: this is done in RUP Builder 
    after you have exported the plug-in. This will enable you to view the plug-in 
    fully in the context of a published RUP configuration, and have others review 
    it as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ExportPlugin"></a>Export plug-in <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>
<p>To make your Plug-in available for project managers to include in their projects, 
  you must export it from RUP Organizer. This is done with the Export Plug-in 
  button on the toolbar. You will be prompted for a location for your plug-in.</p>
<p>When you do this, RUP packages your layout, including overlays of the base 
  process, and all of your content files into a single file with a .cfu extension. 
  This is the Plug-in that can be imported into RUP Builder for inclusion in a 
  RUP configuration.</p>
