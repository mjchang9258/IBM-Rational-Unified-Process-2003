<H3>Overview</H3>
      <P>
       Setting up Rose for a project means laying the foundation that
       will enable many team members to work on the same model at the same time.
       Developing complex systems requires that groups of analysts, architects,
       and developers be able to see and access the &quot;big picture&quot; at
       the same time as they are working on their own portion of that picture&#151simultaneously.
       Successfully managing an environment where multiple team members have
       different kinds of access to the same model requires:</P>
      <ul>
        <li>Formulating a working strategy for managing team activity.</li>
        <li>Having the tools that can support that strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <P>
       Ideally, Rose users work within their own private workspace
       where they are protected from changes that may be untested or not yet
       approved.</P>
      <P>
       The following are the basic steps for laying this foundation:</P>

      <P>
       When developing a strategy for working in teams, there are two facets to
       consider:</P>
      <ul>
        <li>developing a strategy that supports current development</li>
        <li>developing a strategy for maintaining and retrieving the reusable
          modeling artifacts that result</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When developing current projects, the tools a team uses must be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide all team members with simultaneous access to the entire
          model</li>
        <li>control which team members can update different model elements</li>
        <li>introduce change in a controlled manner</li>
        <li>maintain multiple versions of a model</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you develop a system, you are developing valuable project
      artifacts that can be reused. Artifacts are typically maintained in some
      type of repository. To support reuse:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Model artifacts should be architecturally significant units, such as
          patterns, frameworks, and components (not usually individual classes).</li>
        <li>All team members, no matter where they are located, should have
          access to reusable artifacts.</li>
        <li>It should be easy to catalog, find, and then apply these artifacts
          in a model.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A reuse repository can differ from your project's configuration
      management (CM) system as long as it supports versioning. The repository
      should also support cataloging artifacts at an appropriate level of
      granularity; for example, at the component level.</p>
      <H3>
       2. <A NAME="Create Swimlanes (Optional)"></a>Define Rational Rose
       defaults <A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../../images/top.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" ALT="To top of page" BORDER="0" width="26" height="20"></a></H3>
      <P>
 Rose enables you to set model-wide operating defaults, called
       properties and options, that essentially establish the &quot;rules&quot;
       that users follow when working with the model. The settings you create
       are stored in the rose.ini file, which should be put under configuration
       control if you are using a CM system. You access the model properties and
       options from the <b> Tools &gt; Options</b> menu.</P>
      <H3>
       3. <A NAME="Create and Describe an Activity State in the Diagram"></a>Partition
       the model into controlled units <A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../../images/top.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" ALT="To top of page" BORDER="0" width="26" height="20"></a></H3>
      <P>
 Rose supports dividing a model into manageable pieces by letting
       you partition a model into separate files called <b>controlled units</b>.
       When using controlled units, each team or each team member is responsible
       for maintaining or updating a specific unit. The lowest level of
       granularity for a controlled unit is a package, since packages are
       considered the smallest architecturally significant elements in a model
       (classes are not). Controlled units are the basis building blocks that
       you put under version control.</P>
      <P>You can create a hierarchy of controlled units where top level
      controlled units can consist of references to other controlled units. For
      example, you could make all packages controlled units with top-level
      packages that are pointers to nested packages. When you do this, you
      enable two developers to check out packages that belong to the same higher
      level package. How you partition a model and the type of hierarchy you
      implement will depend on how team members will operate, both physically
      (who works on which packages) as well as logically (how best to partition
      the model and preserve its design).</P>
      <P>You can create controlled units for packages, deployment diagrams, and
      model properties. When you create controlled units, you name the new file
      but you use one of these four extensions for the particular type of
      controlled unit you're creating:</P>
      <ul>
        <li>logical packages and use-case packages are stored in .cat files</li>
        <li>component packages are stored in .sub files</li>
        <li>deployment packages are stored in .prc files</li>
        <li>model properties are stored in a .prp file</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can have an unlimited number of .cat and .sub files, but since a Rose model supports one deployment diagram, there is only one
      .prc file. Similarly, there is a single set of model properties and only
      one .prp file.</p>
      <H3>
       4. <A NAME="Connect Activity States with Transitions"></a>Define path
       maps <A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../../images/top.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" ALT="To top of page" BORDER="0" width="26" height="20"></a></H3>
      <P>Virtual path maps enable Rose to use relative file paths
      instead of physical file paths when referencing controlled units. This
      feature enables you to move a model between different systems or
      directories and to update a model from different workspaces. When you save
      a model or you create a controlled unit, you save it to a physical
      location. However, you model file and any parent-controlled units rely on
      that file path to locate the controlled units that belong to it. By
      creating and using virtual path maps, you enable Rose to substitute the
      physical file path with a relative file path, freeing your model from its
      ties to a physical location.</P>
      <P>A leading ampersand (&amp;) in a virtual path map indicates the path is
      relative to the model file or the enclosing (parent) controlled unit. A
      common way to implement path maps is to have all team members define
      &amp;CURDIR=&amp;. This enables you to save a model and controlled units
      relative to the surrounding context, letting different users open the
      model and load the unit in different workspaces.</P>
      <H3>
       5. <A NAME="Create Synchronization Bars"></a>Integrate with a
       configuration management system <A HREF="#Top"><IMG SRC="../../images/top.gif" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" ALT="To top of page" BORDER="0" width="26" height="20"></a></H3>
      <P>Implementing a configuration management (CM) system is essential for
      complex projects. A CM system can effectively support team development as
      long as it:</P>
      <ul>
        <li>protects developers from unapproved model changes</li>
        <li>supports comparing and merging all changes made by multiple
          contributors</li>
        <li>supports distributed (geographically dispersed) development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider using the same CM tool to maintain the models that you use for
      your other project artifacts, such as source code and dlls.</p>
      <P>Since managing parallel development is so crucial, Rose
      provides integrations with Rational ClearCase and with SCC-compliant
      version control systems, such as Microsoft Visual Source Safe. By
      integrating CM systems, Rose makes the most frequently used version
      control commands directly accessible from Rose menus, including the
      typical check in and check out functions that are used every day.</P>
