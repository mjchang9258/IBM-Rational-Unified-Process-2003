<b><font size="5"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></font></b></font><font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p>The key to achieving the delicate balance between delivering quality software 
  and delivering it quickly (the software paradox!) is to understand the essential 
  elements of the process and to follow certain guidelines for tailoring the process 
  to best fit your project's specific needs. This should be done while adhering 
  to the best practices that have been proven throughout the industry to help 
  software development projects be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The following describes the essential principles of an effective 
  software process.</p>
<h3><a name="Vision"></a>1. <i>Vision</i>&#151;Develop a Vision<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p>In particular, developing a clear Vision is key to developing a product that 
  meets your<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>stakeholders’ <i>real 
  </i>needs&#148;.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
      
<p class="MsoNormal">In RUP, the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_vsion.htm">Vision</a> 
  artifact captures very high-level requirements and design constraints, to give 
  the reader an understanding of the system to be developed. It provides input 
  to the project-approval process, and is therefore intimately related to the 
  Business Case. It communicates the fundamental &quot;why's and what's&quot; 
  related to the project and is a gauge against which all future decisions should 
  be validated.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The contents of the Vision&#151;along with any other related 
  requirements artifacts&#151;should answer the following questions, which might 
  be broken out to separate, more detailed, artifacts, as needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li> What are the key terms? (Glossary)</li>
  <li>
    What problem are we trying to solve? (Problem Statement)</li>
  <li>
    Who are the stakeholders? Who are the users? What are
    their needs?</li>
  <li>
    What are the product features?</li>
  <li> What are the functional requirements? (Use Cases)</li>
  <li>
    What are the non-functional requirements?</li>
  <li>
    What are the design constraints?</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing a clear vision and an understandable set of requirements is the 
  essence of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_req.htm">Requirements discipline</a>, 
  and the <a href="im_bp2.htm"> Best Practice: Manage Requirements</a>. This involves 
  analyzing the problem, understanding stakeholder needs, defining the system, 
  and managing the requirements as they change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p> 
  &nbsp; 
<h3><a name="Plan"></a>2. <i>Plan</i>&#151;Manage to the Plan</h3>
<p>&#147;The product is only as good as the plan for the product&#148; <span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-footnote-id: ftn1" class="MsoFootnoteReference">(<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Conceiving a new project; evaluating scope and risk; monitoring 
  and controlling the project; planning for and evaluating each iteration and 
  phase - these are the &#147;essence&#148; of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_mgm.htm">Project 
  Management discipline</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_sdp.htm">Software Development 
  Plan</a> gathers the information required to manage the project.<o:p></o:p> 
  It is used to plan the project schedule and resource needs, and to track progress 
  against the schedule. It addresses such areas as:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>project organization, schedule, budget, and resources. It may also include 
  plans for requirements management, configuration management, problem resolution, 
  quality assurance, evaluation and test, and product acceptance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a simple project, many of these topics can be covered 
  by one or two sentences each. For example, configuration management planning 
  may simply state: &#147;At the end of each day, the contents of the project 
  directory structure will be zipped, copied onto a dated, labeled zip disk, marked 
  with a version number and placed in the central filing cabinet.&#148;<o:p> </o:p> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The format of the planning artifacts are not as important 
  as the planning activities and the thought that goes into them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>It doesn't matter what the plans look like – or what tools you use to 
  build them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Dwight D. Eisenhower 
  said, &#147;The plan is nothing; the planning is everything.&#148;<o:p> </o:p><o:p></o:p> 
</p>
<h3><a name="Risks"></a>3. <i>Risks</i>&#151;Mitigate Risks and Track Related 
  Issues</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is essential to identify and attack the highest risk items 
  early in the project and track them, along with other related issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>The <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_rskls.htm">Risk List</a> is intended 
  to capture the perceived risks to the success of the project. It identifies, 
  in decreasing order of priority, the events which could lead to a significant 
  negative outcome.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Along with each risk, should be a plan for mitigating that
risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This serves as a focal point
for planning project activities, and is the basis around which iterations are
organized.</p>
<h3><a name="BusinessCase"></a>4. <i>Business Case</i>&#151;Examine the Business 
  Case</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_bcase.htm">Business
Case</a> provides the necessary information, from a business standpoint, to
determine whether or not this project is worth investing in.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The main purpose of the Business Case is to develop an economic 
  plan for realizing the project Vision. Once developed, the Business Case is 
  used to make an accurate assessment of the return on investment (ROI) provided 
  by the project. It provides the justification for the project and establishes 
  its economic constraints. It provides information to the economic decision makers 
  on the project's worth, and is used to determine whether the project should 
  move ahead.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The description should not delve deeply into the specifics
of the problem, but rather it should create a compelling argument why the
product is needed. It must be brief, however, so that it is easy enough for all
project team members to understand and remember. At critical milestones, the
Business Case is re-examined to see if estimates of expected return and cost are
still accurate, and whether the project should be continued</p>
<h3><a name="Architecture"></a>5. <i>Architecture</i>&#151;Design a Component 
  Architecture<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Rational Unified Process (RUP), the architecture of 
  a software system (at a given point) is the organization or structure of the 
  system's significant components interacting through interfaces, with components 
  composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>What 
  are the main pieces?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>And how do 
  they fit together?<o:p>&nbsp; Do we have a framework on which the rest of the 
  software can be added? </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To speak and reason about software architecture, you must 
  first define an architectural representation, a way of describing important 
  aspects of an architecture. This description is captured in the <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_sadoc.htm">Software 
  Architecture Document</a>, which presents the architecture in multiple views.<o:p> 
  </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each architectural view addresses some specific set of concerns, 
  specific to stakeholders in the development process: end users, designers, managers, 
  system engineers, maintainers, and so on. This serves as a communication medium 
  between the software architect and other project team members regarding architecturally 
  significant decisions which have been made on the project.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Defining a candidate architecture, refining the architecture, 
  analyzing behavior, and designing components of the system is the &#147;essence&#148; 
  of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_and.htm">Analysis and Design discipline</a>, 
  and the <a href="im_bp3.htm">Best Practice: Use Component Architectures</a>. 
</p>
<h3><a name="Prototype"></a>6. <i>Prototype</i>&#151;Incrementally Build and Test 
  the Product<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p>The RUP is an iterative approach of building, testing, and evaluating executable 
  versions of the product in order to flush out the problems and resolve risks 
  and issues as early as possible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Incrementally building and testing the components of the 
  system is the &#147;essence&#148; of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_impl.htm">Implementation</a>&nbsp; 
  and <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_test.htm"> Test</a> disciplines, and 
  the <a href="im_bp1.htm">Best Practice: Develop Iteratively</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="Evaluation"></a>7. <i>Evaluation</i>&#151;Regularly Assess Results</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Continuous open communication with objective data derived 
  directly from ongoing activities, and the evolving product configurations are 
  important in any project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regular 
  <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_stass.htm">status assessments</a> provide 
  a mechanism for addressing, communicating, and resolving management issues, 
  technical issues, and project risks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 
  addition to identifying the issues, each should be assigned a due date, with 
  a responsible person who is accountable for the resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>This should be regularly tracked and updated as necessary.<o:p> </o:p> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These project snapshots provide the heartbeat for management 
  attention. While the period may vary, the forcing function needs to capture 
  the project history and resolve to remove any roadblocks or bottlenecks that 
  restrict progress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_itass.htm">Iteration 
  Assessment</a> captures the results of an iteration, the degree to which the 
  evaluation criteria were met, the lessons learned and process changes to be 
  implemented.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Iteration Assessment is an essential artifact of the
iterative approach. Depending on the scope and risk of the project and the
nature of the iteration, it may range from a simple record of demonstration and
outcomes to a complete formal test review record.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The key here is to focus on process problems, as well as
product problems: &quot;The sooner you fall behind, the more time you will have
to catch up.&quot;</p>
<h3><a name="ChangeRequests"></a>8. <i>Change Requests</i>&#151;Manage and Control 
  Changes<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As soon as the first prototype is put before the users (and 
  often even before that), changes <i>will </i>be requested. (One of those certainties 
  of life!) In order to control those changes and effectively manage the scope 
  of the project and expectations of the stakeholders, it is important that all 
  changes to any development artifacts be proposed through <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_crqst.htm">Change 
  Requests</a> and managed with a consistent process.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Change Requests are used to document and track defects,
enhancement requests and any other type of request for a change to the product.
The benefit of Change Requests is that they provide a record of decisions, and,
due to their assessment process, ensure that impacts of the potential change are
understood by all project team members. The Change Requests are essential for
managing the scope of the project, as well as assessing the impact of proposed
changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Manage and controlling the scope of the project, as
changes occur throughout the project lifecycle, while maintaining the goal of
considering all stakeholder needs and meeting those, to whatever extent possible
- this is the &#147;essence&#148; of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_cm.htm">Configuration and Change
Management discipline</a>, and the <a href="im_bp6.htm">Best Practice: Control
Changes</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="UserSupport"></a>9. <i>User Support</i>&#151;Deploy a Usable Product<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of a process is to produce a usable
product.&nbsp; All aspects of the process should be tailored with this goal in
mind.&nbsp; The product is typically more than just the software.&nbsp; At
a minimum, there should be a User’s Guide, perhaps implemented through
online help.&nbsp; You may also include an Installation Guide and Release Notes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the complexity of the product, training
materials may also be needed, as well as a bill of materials along with any
product packaging. The 
associated activities form the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_dep.htm"> Deployment
discipline</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="Process"></a>10. <i>Process</i>&#151;Adopt a Process that Fits Your 
  Project<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p>It is essential that a process be chosen which fits the type of product you 
  are developing. Even after a process is chosen, it must not be followed blindly 
  &#151; common sense and experience must be applied to configure the process 
  and tools to meet the needs of the organization and the project.</p>
<p>Adapting a process for a project is a key part of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_env.htm"> 
  Environment discipline</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on adapting RUP to your project and organization, see: 
  <a href="../../process/workflow/environm/co_polpr.htm">Concepts: RUP Tailoring</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion<font size="5"><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The above &quot;essentials&quot; provide a means of quickly
assessing a process and identifying areas where improvement is most
beneficial.&nbsp; It is important to explore what will happen if any of these
essentials is ignored.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    vision? You may lose track of where you are going and may be easily distracted 
    on detours.</li>
  <li>No process? Without a common process, the team may have miscommunications 
    and misunderstandings about who is going to do what &#151; and when.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    plan? You will not be able to track progress.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    risk list? You may be focusing on the wrong issues now and may explode on 
    an unsuspected mine 5 months from now.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    business case? You risk losing time and money on the project. It may be cancelled 
    or go bankrupt.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    architecture? You may be unable to handle communication, synchronization, 
    and data access issues as they arise; there may be problems with scaling and 
    performance.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    product (prototype)? As soon as possible, get a product in front of the customer. 
    Just accumulating paperwork doesn't assure you or the customer that the product 
    will be successful&#151;and it maximizes risk of budget and schedule overruns 
    and/or outright failure.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    evaluation? Don’t keep your head in the sand. It is important to face the 
    truth. How close are you really to your deadline? To your goals in quality 
    or budget? Are all issues adequately being tracked?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    change requests? How do you keep track of requests from your stakeholders? 
    How do you prioritize them? And keep the lower priority ones from falling 
    through the cracks?</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo15;tab-stops:list .5in">No 
    user support? What happens when a user has a question or can’t figure out 
    how to use the product?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How easy 
    is it to get help?</li>
</ul>
<p>These &quot;essentials&quot; also provide an introduction to each of the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_core.htm"> 
  disciplines</a> of the RUP, and many of its <a href="im_bp.htm">best practices</a>.&nbsp; 
  There is one discipline not mentioned&#151<a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_busm.htm">Business 
  Modeling</a>&#151that has activities related to understanding the structure 
  and the dynamics of the organization.&nbsp; While not represented here as essential, 
  you may wish to explore this discipline further, as you may decide that some 
  aspects are useful (or even essential) for your organization.</p>
