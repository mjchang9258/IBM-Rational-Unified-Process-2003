<h2><a name="What are Component Architectures">What Does Component Architecture
Mean</a>? <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>A Component Architecture is an architecture based on replaceable components 
  as described in <a href="../../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_component.htm">Concepts: 
  Component</a>. Because Component Architectures are based on independent, replaceable, 
  modular components, they help to manage complexity and encourage re-use.</p>
<h2><a name="Architectural Emphasis">Architectural Emphasis</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Use cases drive the Rational Unified Process (RUP) end-to-end over the whole
lifecycle, but the design activities are centered around the notion of system<i>
</i><a href="../../process/glossary.htm#architecture">architecture</a>
 and, for software-intensive systems, software architecture.
The main focus of the early iterations of the process&#151;mostly in the
elaboration phase&#151;is to produce and validate a <a href="../../process/glossary.htm#software_architecture">software
architecture</a><i>, </i>which in the initial development cycle takes the form
of an executable architectural prototype that gradually evolves to become the
final system in later iterations.</p>
<p>By executable architecture, we mean a
partial implementation of the system built to demonstrate selected system
functions and properties, in particular those satisfying non-functional
requirements. The purpose of executable architecture is to mitigate risks related to performance, throughput,
capacity, reliability, and other &quot;ilities&quot;, so that the complete functional
capability of the system may be added in the <a href="../../process/glossary.htm#construction">construction
phase</a> on a solid foundation, without fear of breakage.</p>
<p>For an introduction to the notion of architecture&#151;most specifically
software architecture&#151;and an explanation of why this notion is crucial, see <a href="../../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_swarch.htm">Concepts:
Software Architecture</a>.</p>
      <p>The RUP provides a methodical, systematic way to 
        design, develop, and validate an architecture. We offer templates for 
        architectural description around the concepts of multiple architectural 
        views, and for the capture of architectural style, design rules, and constraints. 
        The <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_and.htm">Analysis 
        and Design</a> discipline contains specific activities aimed at identifying 
        architectural constraints and architecturally significant elements, as 
        well as guidelines on how to make architectural choices. The management 
        process shows how the planning of the early iterations takes into account 
        the design of an architecture and the resolution of the major technical 
        risks. See the <a href="../../process/workflow/ovu_mgm.htm">Project Management</a> 
        discipline and all activities associated with the <a href="../../process/workers/wk_archt.htm">Role: 
        Software Architect</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Architecture is important for several reasons:
<ul>
  <li>It lets you gain and retain intellectual control over the project, to
    manage its complexity and to maintain system integrity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system is more than the sum of its parts; more than a succession of
small independent tactical decisions. It must have some unifying, coherent
structure to organize those parts systematically and it must provide precise rules on
how to grow the system without having its complexity &quot;explode&quot; beyond
human understanding.</p>
<p>The architecture establishes the means for improved communication and
understanding throughout the project by establishing a common set of references,
a common vocabulary with which to discuss design issues.
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It is an effective basis for large-scale reuse.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By clearly articulating the major components and the critical interfaces
between them, an architecture lets you reason about reuse&#151;both internal reuse,
which is the identification of common parts, and external reuse, which is the incorporation of
ready-made, off-the-shelf components. However, it also allows reuse on a larger
scale: the reuse of the architecture itself in the context of a line of products
that addresses different functionality in a common domain.
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It provides a basis for project management.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Planning and staffing are organized along the lines of major components.
Fundamental structural decisions are taken by a small, cohesive architecture
team; they are not distributed. Development is partitioned across a set of small
teams, each responsible for one or several parts of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="Component-Based Development (CBD)">Component-Based Development</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Component-based development is a variation on general application development 
  in which:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>The application is <b>built from discrete executable components</b> 
      which are<b> developed relatively independently of one another</b>, 
      potentially by different teams. These are referred to in RUP as &quot;assembly 
      components&quot;. See <a href="../../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_component.htm">Concepts: 
      Component</a> for a more detailed definition. </li>
    <li>The application may be <b>upgraded in smaller increments</b> 
      by upgrading only some of the assembly components that comprise the application.</li>
    <li>Assembly components may be shared between applications, 
      creating opportunities for <b>reuse</b>, but also creating <b>inter-project 
      dependencies</b>.</li>
    <li>Though not strictly related to being component-based, component-based 
      applications tend to be <b>distributed</b>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Assembly components result from the following: 
<ul>
  <li>In defining a very modular architecture, you identify, isolate, design, 
    develop, and test well-formed components. These components can be individually 
    tested and gradually integrated to form the whole system.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, some of these components can be developed to be reusable, especially 
    the components that provide common solutions to a wide range of common problems. 
    These reusable components, which may be larger than just collections of utilities 
    or class libraries, form the basis of reuse within an organization, increasing 
    overall software productivity and quality.</li>
  <li>More recently, the advent of commercially successful, component infrastructures&#151;such 
    as CORBA, the Internet, ActiveX, JavaBeans, .NET and J2EE &#151; trigger a whole 
    industry of off-the-shelf components for various domains, allowing you to 
    buy and integrate components rather than developing them all in-house.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first point in the preceding list exploits the old concepts of modularity 
  and encapsulation, bringing those concepts underlying object-oriented technology 
  a step further. The last two points in the list shift software development from 
  programming software one line at a time, to composing software by assembling 
  components.</p>

<p><a name="XE_component-based_development_(CBD)__as_a_feature_in_the_Unified_Process"></a>The
RUP supports component-based development in these ways:
<ul>
  <li>The iterative approach allows you to progressively identify components, 
    and decide which ones to develop, which ones to reuse, and which ones to buy.</li>
  <li>The focus on software architecture allows you to articulate the structure&#151;the 
    components and the ways in which they integrate&#151;which include the fundamental 
    mechanisms and patterns by which they interact. This in turn supports the 
    planning aspects of project management, in that the component dependencies 
    can help determine which components can be developed concurrently, and which 
    sequentially.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Concepts, such as packages, subsystems, and layers, are used during Analysis 
    &amp; Design to organize components and to specify interfaces.</li>
  <li>Testing is first organized around components, then gradually around larger 
    sets of integrated components.</li>
</ul>
