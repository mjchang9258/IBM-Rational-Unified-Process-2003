<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h1>
<p>Usability Engineering (also called User-Centered Design) is all about building 
  better systems by getting a better understanding of the end-users, and involving 
  users in requirements, user interface design, and testing efforts. Basic concepts 
  are described in <a href="../process/workflow/requirem/co_ucd.htm">Concepts: 
  User-Centered Design</a>, and should be read prior to this concept. This concept 
  page explains how the Rational Unified Process (RUP) currently addresses usability 
  engineering techniques.</p>

<h1><a name="roles"></a>Roles<a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h1>
      
<p> The RUP has a number of roles responsible for usability concerns. The  
  <a href="../process/workers/wk_bpan.htm">Business-Process Analyst</a>, <a href="../process/workers/wk_sysan.htm">System 
  Analyst</a> and <a href="../process/workers/wk_ucaut.htm">Requirements Specifier</a> 
  must be skilled in gathering and analyzing information about users, their tasks, 
  and their environment, and capturing these in the requirements and 
  business modeling artifacts. This material is reviewed by the <a href="../process/workers/wk_tchrvw.htm">Requirements 
  Reviewer</a> 
  and <a href="../process/workers/wk_tchrvw.htm">Business Model Reviewer</a> respectively. 
  The <a href="../process/workers/wk_tstr.htm">Tester</a> and <a href="../process/workers/wk_tstanl.htm">Test 
  Analyst</a> roles are primarily responsible for usability testing. The <a href="../process/workers/wk_uides.htm">User-Interface 
  Designer</a> is responsible for the design and the &quot;visual shaping&quot; 
  of the user interface. The <a href="../process/workers/wk_implm.htm">Implementer</a> 
  selects and/or develops user interface components to construct the functioning 
  user interface.</p>     
<p>The <a href="../process/workers/wk_projm.htm">Project Manager</a> also has 
  a key role. He/she enables users to be involved in the development process, 
  and ensures that the development organization is staffed with the skills required 
  to build usable systems. Other roles, such as <a href="../process/workers/wk_depm.htm">Deployment 
  Manager</a>, <a href="../process/workers/wk_crsdv.htm">Course Developer</a>, 
  and <a href="../process/workers/wk_tchwr.htm">Technical Writer</a> also have 
  responsibilities for ensuring that the deployed system is usable.</p>
  
<h1><a name="disciplines"></a>Disciplines<a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h1>
<p>The following sections describe RUP disciplines in terms of the activities 
  and artifacts which are most important to usability.</p>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>From a usability perspective, the Requirements discipline focusses on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>establishing an understanding of the users and their needs</li>
  <li> identifying the use cases of greatest benefit to the users.</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific activities and artifacts are as follows.</p>

<h1><a name="phases">Iterative Development and Phases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h1>
<p>The software lifecycle of the RUP is decomposed over time into four sequential 
  <a href="../process/itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">phases</a>, each concluded by a major 
  milestone; each phase is essentially a span of time between two major milestones. 
  At each phase-end an assessment is performed  
  (<a href="../process/activity/ac_lmrev.htm">Activity: Lifecycle Milestone Review</a>) 
   to determine whether the objectives of the phase have been met. A satisfactory 
  assessment allows the project to move to the next phase.</p>
<p>Within each phase may be several <a href="../process/workflow/manageme/co_phase.htm">iterations</a>. 
  An iteration is a complete development loop resulting in a release (internal 
  or external) of an executable product, a subset of the final product under development, 
  which grows incrementally from iteration to iteration to become the final system. 
  Usability benefits greatly from this iterative approach. It allows users to 
  provide early feedback on usability, and avoids heading too far down a path 
  which simply won't meet user needs.</p>
<p>The user should be involved in each iteration, to further refine requirements, 
  to evaluate design concepts, and test/evaluate the usability of both proof-of-concept 
  prototypes and the evolving system.</p>
<p>The following sections describe the usability-related phase completion criteria 
  and the main activities for each phase.</p>
  
<h2><a name="Inception">Inception</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Two key objectives of <a href="../process/itrwkfls/iwf_iii.htm">Inception Phase</a> 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishing the project's software scope and boundary conditions, including 
    an operational vision, acceptance criteria and what is intended to be in the 
    product and what is not.</li>
  <li>Discriminating the critical use cases of the system, the primary scenarios 
    of operation that will drive the major design trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a usability engineering perspective, this means emphasizing Requirements 
  and Business Modeling activities related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>establishing an understanding of the users and their needs</li>
  <li> identifying the use cases of greatest benefit to the users.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../process/itrwkfls/iwf_iii.htm">Inception phase</a> is also often 
  the time to explore some conceptual design and "proof of concept" prototyping. 
  This is particularly true when the primary project risks are related to the 
  user interface and usability concerns. <a href="../process/workflow/test/co_ustst.htm">Usability 
  testing</a>, including usability-related <a href="../process/workflow/test/co_perfo.htm">performance 
  testing</a>, should be started as soon as there are mockups or executable prototypes 
  of the user interface.</p>
  
<h2><a name="Elaboration">Elaboration</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>As RUP is an iterative process, the artifacts created in Inception are revisited 
  and reviewed with users in order to manage scope and ensure that the evolving 
  system meets user needs. 
<p>In <a href="../process/itrwkfls/iwf_iie.htm">Elaboration</a>, the focus is 
  on the <a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_swarch.htm">software architecture</a> 
  - including the architecture of the user interface. The conceptual user interface 
  is defined, and the critical and/or risky elements of the user interface design 
  are implemented. Activities related to the software architecture apply in general 
  to the user interface - there are off-the-shelf products that must be evaluated, 
  reuse considerations, selection of mechanisms and patterns, etc. 
<p>This phase emphasizes the user interface design activities, as well as supporting 
  activities from the Analysis and Design discipline. Implementation and Test 
  are also involved, since completion of Elaboration requires that a running system 
  be constructed which can be evaluated.</p>
<p><a href="../process/workflow/test/co_ustst.htm">Usability testing</a>, and 
  usability-related <a href="../process/workflow/test/co_perfo.htm">performance 
  testing</a>, should focus on any risky requirements captured in the <a href="../process/artifact/ar_sspec.htm">Supplementary 
  Specifications</a> or as &quot;Special Requirements&quot; in the <a href="../webtmpl/templates/req/rup_ucspec.htm" target="_blank">use 
  case specification</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Construction">Construction</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>In <a href="../process/itrwkfls/iwf_lic.htm">Construction</a>, the focus is 
  on implementing more use cases. This involves adding to the user interface, 
  while remaining true to the conceptual model of the user interface and user-interface 
  guidelines captured in the <a href="../process/artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project-Specific 
  Guidelines</a>. <a href="../process/workflow/test/co_ustst.htm">Usability Testing</a> 
  continues to be very important as new features are added.</p>
<p>The selection of what functionality to place in each iteration is based on 
  value to users.</p>

  starts to shift towards the <a href="../process/workflow/ovu_dep.htm">Deployment</a> 
  discipline. In a user-centered development effort, you shouldn't wait until 
  Transition phase to involve the user. However, the user continues to be involved, 
  primarily to give feedback. When the user has been involved throughout the development, 
  formal beta and acceptance testing is often significantly minimized or non-existent. 
  Instead, detailed user feedback and approval occurs throughout the development 
  effort.</p> 
<p>Development of training material and system support material is finalized in 
  Transition, but it should be started in earlier phases, if possible, in order 
  to allow user feedback.</p>
<p>In Transition, there is a working system that can be used by end-users. It 
  is a good idea to plan at least a couple of iterations during transition, so 
  that problems with the initial release can be corrected, and so that key user 
  feedback can be incorporated.</p>
