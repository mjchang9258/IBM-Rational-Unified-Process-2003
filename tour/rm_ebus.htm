<h4>Business Modeling<o:p> </o:p> </h4>

<p class="node">In general, there is a much higher focus on business modeling

compared to other types of development efforts. To develop an e-business

application generally means to develop a new way of doing business; it's an

integral part of the way you run your business.

    Assess Business Status</b></a></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>

  <p class="node">The focus here is to understand the

  problems the new business should solve, and also the effects of not developing the

  new business.</p>

  <p class="node">Building e-business solutions involves a

  greater variety of stakeholders than other software application development

  projects. These stakeholders will usually include business executives,

  marketing, creative design, customer support, and the technology development

  team, among others.</p>

  <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_sgoals.htm">Activity: Set

  and Adjust Goals</a> focuses on ensuring that the new business

  will meet the needs of this varied group of stakeholders. The primary artifact

  where these needs are expressed is the <a href="../process/artifact/ar_bvsio.htm">Business

  Vision</a>. Given the diverse backgrounds of the stakeholders, a facilitated

  workshop, like the one described in <a href="../process/workguid/wg_rqwsh.htm">Work

  Guidelines: Requirements Workshop</a>, is often needed to bring the group

  together. Extensive use of storyboards to describe the desired customer

  experience tend to be useful in eliciting feedback (see <a href="../process/workguid/wg_stbd.htm">Work

  Guidelines: Storyboarding</a>).</p>

  <p class="node">Sometimes the stakeholders are not available because they

  are only on the Internet. In these cases an important role of the Business

  Vision document is to describe how the stakeholders or customers should find

  the Web site and how user feedback is going to be collected. As well, in these cases

  you can develop prototypes to learn how customers find the Web site and how

  they are using it. The need to obtain this kind of feedback may affect the

  length of the iterations and the product lifecycle.

    <p class="node">The <a href="../process/activity/ac_arcan.htm">Activity: Architectural 

      Analysis</a> takes advantage of the knowledge that a Web application has 

      a relatively well-defined architecture, including a set of well-defined 

      mechanisms (Web browsers, Java applets and servlets, ASPs and JSPs, and 

      the like). Usually a simple layering structure as described in <a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_layer.htm">Concepts: 

      Layering</a> is sufficient unless the Web application development framework

      architectures that can be purchased or re-used from prior Web development 

      projects. Web application frameworks, such as IBM's WebSphere or Microsoft's 

      Windows DNA, provide just this sort of architectural template.</p>

    <p class="node">Web applications typically do not have scheduled downtime. 

      The architecture may (and typically does) need to provide for upgrading 

      the system while it's running, and switching to standby servers during primary 

      server failure or when maintenance or server upgrades occur. Some Web application 

      frameworks provide tools for production support. Regardless, if your application

      the User Interface</a> is performed iteratively within the Elaboration iterations. 

      The early executions of this activity focus on producing 'creative design 

      comps', which are mocked-up representations of the design of key Web pages 

      in the site. These 'comps' are typically &quot;flat&quot; pictures framed 

      with browser window graphics to give a look of a browser window. The main 

      benefit of 'comps' is to postpone the investment of more elaborate and costly 

      HTML prototypes until there is consensus on the specific graphical direction 

      for the site.</p>

    <p class="node">'Creative Design Comps' are created by looking at the interface 

      requirements of the most important Use Cases and developing many alternative 

      designs (perhaps 10 or more) for its look and feel. From this set, the three 

      most promising options are chosen to present to the stakeholders. This is 

      done iteratively until there is agreement on the final Web design, resulting

      server. If this is forgotten, the most significant portion of the system
