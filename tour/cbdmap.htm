  <p class="node">The focus of the <a href="../process/activity/ac_dbzcs.htm">Activity: 
    Develop Business Case</a> is adjusted to take into account that using components 
    change the cost structure of development. In specific, the cost of developing 
    components decreases, but more effort is spent on identifying components and

 </ul>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../process/workflow/manageme/wfs_eval.htm"><b>Workflow
    Detail: Evaluate Project Scope and Risk</b></a></li>
  <p class="node">Taking a component approach changes the nature of certain
  risks and introduces new risks. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>externally-sourced components increase risk because they introduce
      critical elements not under the direct control of the project team</li>
    <li>externally-sourced components can reduce development time, reducing
      resource risk</li>
    <li>externally-sourced components can distort the architecture of the system
      if they impose architectural restrictions of their own</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  <p class="node">In the <a href="../process/activity/ac_plph.htm">Activity: Plan 
    Phases and Iterations</a>, the plan for the Construction phase may potentially 
    show the project splitting into two different but parallel tracks: one which 
    develops the application-specific and domain-specific components (organized 
    in the upper layers of the architecture - see <a href="../process/workflow/ana_desi/co_layer.htm">Concepts: 
    Layering</a>), and the non-application and non-domain-specific components 
    organized in lower layers. In some cases, reusable components will be developed 
    by independently managed development teams. The decision to introduce parallel 
    tracks is largely a staffing and resource issue introduced by a desire to 
    manage reusable components as assets independent of the applications in which 
    they are deployed.</p>

    classes within the component which provide the real behavior of the component. 
    In the early stages of the Elaboration phase, there is likely to be a single 
    class, a kind of 'subsystem/component proxy' which acts as a stub to simulate 
    the behavior of the component for architectural prototyping purposes. Later 
    the behavior of this class is distributed to a collaboration of classes contained

    <ul>
      <li>exercising the interfaces between components, to ensure that component 
        boundaries are appropriate, and</li>
      <li>a greater focus on performance testing, especially performance scaling 
        tests, to ensure that anticipated transaction volumes can be sustained</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="node">Any inherent assumptions in the component framework need to 
      be assessed as well. These commonly include the scalability and throughput 
      of the persistence and transaction management mechanisms, in which hidden

          This, of course, depends on having sufficient resources to staff parallel
