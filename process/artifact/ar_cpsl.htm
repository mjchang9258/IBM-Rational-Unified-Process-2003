<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p class="reactive"><b>Capsules</b> represent a specific pattern of class structure and
composition which has proven useful in modeling and designing systems which have
a high degree of concurrency. Using a capsule as a short-hand notation for a
specific, proven design pattern makes design easier and less error-prone.</p>
<p class="reactive">A capsule is represented as a Class, stereotyped <b>&laquo;capsule&raquo;</b>. 
  A capsule is a composite element, as depicted in the figure below.</p>
<p align="center" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl3.gif" width="492" height="279"></p>
<p align="center" class="reactivepicturetext">Capsule Composition</p>
<p class="reactive">As noted above, a capsule may have ports, and may &quot;contain&quot; passive
classes and/or sub-capsules. It may also have a state machine which completely
describes the behavior of the capsule. A specific taxonomy of capsules and
various ways in which they can be used are discussed in <a href="../modguide/md_cpsl.htm">Guidelines:
Capsule</a>.</p>
<h3 class="reactive"><a name="Properties">Properties</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p class="reactive"><b>A capsule encapsulates a thread of control.</b> A capsule is an
abstraction of an independent thread of control in the system; it is the primary
unit of concurrency in the system. Additional isolation of threads of control
may be done through the use of operating system process and threads, by mapping
capsules to specific operating system processes and threads. Messages to the
capsule arrive via a port, and are processed sequentially; if the capsule
instance is busy, messages are queued. Capsules enforce run-to-completion
semantics, so that when an event is received, it is completely processed
regardless of the number or priority of other events arriving.</p>
<p class="reactive"><b>A capsule interacts with its surroundings through ports.</b> A
port is a <b>signal-based</b> boundary object; it mediates the interaction of
the capsule with the outside world. A port implements a specific interface and
may be dependent on a specific interface. A capsule cannot have operations or
public parts other than ports, which are its exclusive means of interaction with
the external world.</p>
<p class="reactive"><b>Each port plays a particular role in a collaboration</b>. The
collaboration describes how the capsule interacts with other objects. To capture
the complex semantics of these interactions, ports are associated with a <b>protocol</b><i>
</i>that defines the valid flow of information (signals) between connected ports
of capsules. The protocol captures the contractual obligations that exist
between capsules. By forcing capsules to communicate solely through ports, it is
possible to fully de-couple the internal implementations of the capsule from the
environment surrounding the capsule. This makes capsules highly reusable.</p>
<p class="reactive"><b>A simple capsule's functionality is realized directly the capsule's
state machine.</b> More complex capsules combine the state machine with an<b>
internal</b> network of collaborating <b>sub-capsules</b> joined by connectors.
These sub-capsules are capsules in their own right, and can themselves be
decomposed into sub-capsules. This type of decomposition can be carried to
whatever depth is necessary, allowing modeling of arbitrarily complex structures
with just this basic set of structural modeling constructs. The state machine
(which is optional for composite capsules), the sub-capsules, and their
connections network represent parts of the <i>implementation</i> of the capsule
and are hidden from external observers.</p>
<p class="reactive"><b>A capsule may be a composite element. </b>Capsules may be
composed of other capsules and passive classes. Capsules and passive classes are
joined together by connectors or links in a collaboration; this collaboration
defines the 'structure' of the capsule, and so is termed a 'specification
collaboration'. A capsule may have a state machine that can send and receive
signals via the end ports of the capsule and that has control over certain
elements of the internal structure. Hence, this state machine may be regarded as
implementing reflective behavior, that is, behavior that controls the operation
of the capsule itself.</p>
<h4 class="reactive"><a name="Ports">Ports</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p class="reactive">Ports are objects whose purpose is to act as boundary objects for a capsule
instance. They are &quot;owned&quot; by the capsule instance in the sense that
they are created along with their capsule and destroyed when the capsule is
destroyed. Each port has its identity and state that are distinct from the
identity and state of their owning capsule instance (to the same extent that any
part is distinct from its container).</p>
<p class="reactive">Although ports are boundary objects that act as interfaces, 
  they do not map directly to UML interfaces. A UML interface is purely a behavioral 
  thing &#151; it has no implementation structure. A port, on the other hand, 
  includes both structure and behavior. It is a composite part of the structure 
  of the capsule, not simply a constraint on its behavior. It realizes the architectural 
  pattern that we might call &quot;manifest interface&quot;.</p>
<p class="reactive">In UML, we model a port as a class with the &laquo;<i>port</i>&raquo; 
  stereotype. As noted earlier, the type of a port is defined by the protocol 
  role played by that port. Since protocol roles are abstract classes, the actual 
  class corresponding to this instance is one that <b>implements</b> the protocol 
  role associated with the port. In UML the relationship between the port and 
  the protocol role is referred to as a <b>realizes relationship</b>. The notation 
  for this is a dashed line with a solid triangular arrowhead on the specification 
  end. It is a form of generalization whereby the source element &#151; the port 
  &#151; inherits only the behavior specification of the target &#151; the protocol 
  role &#151; but not its structure.</p>
<p class="reactive">A capsule is in a composition relationship with its ports. If the
multiplicity of the target end of this relationship is greater than one, it
means that multiple instances of the port exist at run time, each participating
in a separate instance of the protocol. If the multiplicity is a range of
values, it means that the number of ports can vary at run time and that ports
can be dynamically created and destroyed (possibly subject to constraints).</p>
<p align="center" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl4.gif" width="492" height="161"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactivepicturetext">Ports, protocols, and protocol roles</p>
<p class="reactive">The above figure shows an example of a single port named b belonging to
capsule class CapsuleClassA. This port realizes the master role of the protocol
defined by protocol class ProtocolA. Note that the actual port class, PortClassX,
being an implementation class that may vary from implementation to
implementation, is normally not of interest to the modeler until the
implementation stage. Instead, the information that <i>is</i> of interest is the
protocol role that this port implements. For this reason and also for reasons of
notational convenience, the notation shown in Figure 1 is not normally used and
is replaced by the more compact form described in the following section.</p>
<h5 class="reactive">Notation</h5>
<p class="reactive">In class diagrams, the ports of a capsule are listed in a special labeled
list compartment as illustrated. The <b>ports</b><i> </i>list compartment
normally appears<b> after</b> the attribute and operator list compartments. This
notation takes advantage of the UML feature that allows the addition of specific
named compartments.</p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl5.gif" width="174" height="126"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactivepicturetext">Port notation - class diagram
representation</p>
<p class="reactive">All external ports (relay ports and public end ports) have public visibility
while internal ports have protected visibility (e.g., port b2). The protocol
role (type) of a port is normally identified by a pathname since protocol role
names are unique only within the scope of a given protocol. For example, port b
plays the master role defined in the protocol class called ProtocolA. For the
very frequent case of binary protocols, a simpler notational convention is used:
a suffix tilde symbol (&quot;~&quot;) is used to identify the conjugated
protocol role (e.g., port b2) while the base role name is implicit with no
special annotation (e.g., port b1). Ports with a multiplicity other than 1 have
the multiplicity factor included between square brackets. For example, port
b1[3] has a multiplicity factor of exactly 3 whereas a port designated by
b5[0..2] has a variable number of instances not exceeding 2.</p>
<h3 class="reactive"><a name="Connectors">Connectors</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p class="reactive">A connector represents a communication channel that provides the transmission
facilities for supporting a particular signal-based protocol. A key feature of
connectors is that they can only interconnect ports that play complementary
roles in the protocol associated with the connector. In principle, the protocol
roles do not necessarily have to belong to the same protocol, but in that case
they have to be compatible with the protocol of the connector.</p>
<p class="reactive">Connectors are abstract views of signal-based communication channels that
interconnect two or more ports. The ports bound by a connection must play
mutually complementary but compatible roles in a protocol. In collaboration
diagrams, they are represented by association roles that interconnect the
appropriate ports. If we abstract away the ports from this picture, connectors
really capture the key communication relationships between capsules. These
relationships have architectural significance since they identify which capsules
can affect each other through direct communication. Ports are included to allow
the encapsulation of capsules under the principles of information hiding and
separation of concerns.</p>
<p class="reactive">The similarity between connectors and protocols might suggest that the two
concepts are equivalent. However, this is not the case, since protocols are
abstract specifications of desired behavior while connectors are physical
objects whose function is merely to convey signals from one port to the other.
Typically, the connectors themselves are passive conduits. (In practice,
physical connectors may sometimes deviate from the specified behavior. For
example, as a result of an internal fault, a connector may lose, reorder, or
duplicate messages. This type of failure is common in distributed communication
channels.)</p>
<p class="reactive">A connector is modeled by an association that exists between two or more
ports of the corresponding capsule classes. (For advanced applications in which
the connector has physical properties, an association <i>class</i> may be used
since the connector is actually an object with a state and an identity. As with
ports, the actual class that is used to realize a connector is an implementation
issue.) The relationship to the supported protocol is implicit through the
connected ports. Consequently, no UML extensions are required for representing
connectors.</p>
<h4 class="reactive"><a name="The Specification Collaboration">The Specification Collaboration</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p class="reactive">A capsule's <b>complete</b> internal structure is represented 
  by a specification collaboration. This collaboration includes a specification 
  of all of its ports, sub-capsules, and connectors. Like ports, the sub-capsules 
  and connectors are strongly owned by the capsule and <b>cannot</b> exist independently 
  of the capsule. They are created when the capsule is created and destroyed when 
  their capsule is destroyed.</p>
<p class="reactive">Some sub-capsules in the structure may not be created at the same time as
their containing capsule. Instead, they may be created subsequently, when and if
necessary, by the state machine of the capsule. The state machine can also
destroy such capsules at any time. This follows the UML rules on composition.</p>
<p class="reactive">The structure of a capsule may contain so-called <b>plug-in</b> roles. These
are, in effect, placeholders for sub-capsules that are filled in <b>dynamically</b>.
This is necessary because it is not always known in advance which specific
objects will play those roles at run time. Once this information is available,
the appropriate capsule instance (which is owned by some other composite
capsule) can be &quot;plugged&quot; into such a slot and the connectors joining
its ports to other sub-capsules in the collaboration are automatically
established. When the dynamic relationship is no longer required, the capsule is
&quot;removed&quot; from the plug-in slot, and the connectors to it are taken
down.</p>
<p class="reactive">Dynamically created sub-capsules and plug-ins allow the modeling of
dynamically changing structures while ensuring that all valid communication and
containment relationships between capsules are specified explicitly. This is key
in ensuring architectural integrity in a complex real-time system.</p>
<p class="reactive">Ports may also be depicted in specification collaboration diagrams. In these
diagrams, objects are represented by the appropriate classifier roles, that is,
sub-capsules by <b>capsule roles and ports by port roles</b>. To reduce visual
clutter, port roles are generally shown in iconified form, represented by small
black or white squares. Public ports are represented by port role icons that
straddle the boundary of the corresponding capsule roles as shown in the
previous figure. This shorthand notation allows them to be connected both from
inside and outside the capsule without unnecessary crossing of lines and also
identifies them clearly as boundary objects.</p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl6.gif" width="385" height="62"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactivepicturetext">Port notation - specification
collaboration diagram</p>
<p class="reactive">Note that the labels are adornments to the port roles and should not be
confused with association end names of the connector. Also, because ports are
uniquely identified by their names, it is possible, as a graphical convenience,
to arrange the public port roles around the perimeter of a sub-capsule box in
any order. This can be used to minimize crossovers between connector lines.</p>
<p class="reactive">For the case of binary protocols, an additional stereotype icon can be used:
the port playing the conjugate role is indicated by a white-filled (versus
black-filled) square. In that case, the protocol name and the tilde suffix are
sufficient to identify the protocol role as the conjugate role; the protocol
role name is redundant and should be omitted. Similarly, the use of the protocol
name alone on a black square indicates the base role of the protocol. For
example, if the &quot;master&quot; role in protocol ProtQ&nbsp; is declared as
the base, then the diagrams in the figure below and the figure above are
equivalent. This convention makes it easy to see when complementary protocol
roles are connected.</p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl7.gif" width="385" height="61"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactivepicturetext">Notational conventions for binary
protocols</p>
<p class="reactive">Ports with a multiplicity factor that is greater than one can also be
indicated graphically using the standard UML multiobject notation as shown in
the next figure. This is not mandatory (the multiplicity string is sufficient)
but it emphasizes the possibility of multiple instances of the port.</p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactive"><img src="images/ar_cpsl8.gif" width="220" height="96"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="reactivepicturetext">Ports with multiplicity factor greater

<h4 class="reactive"><a name="The State Machine">The State Machine</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p class="reactive">The optional state machine associated with a capsule is just 
  another part of a capsule's implementation. However, it has certain special 
  properties that distinguish it from the other constituents of a capsule: 
<ul class="reactive">
  <li>It cannot be decomposed further into sub-capsules. It specifies behavior
    directly. State machines, however, can be decomposed into hierarchies of
    simpler state machines using standard UML capabilities.</li>
  <li>There can be at most one such state machine per capsule (although
    sub-capsules can have their own state machines). Capsules that do not have
    state machines are simple containers for sub-capsules.</li>
  <li>It handles signals arriving on any end port of a capsule and can send
    signals through those ports.</li>
  <li>It is the only entity that can access the internal protected parts in its
    capsule. This means that it acts as the <b>controller</b> of all the other
    sub-capsules. As such, it can create and destroy those sub-capsules that are
    identified as dynamic, and it can plug in and remove external sub-capsules
    as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="reactive">Dynamically created sub-capsules are indicated simply by a variable
multiplicity factor. Like plug-in slots, these may also be specified by a pure
interface type. This means that, at instantiation time, any implementation class
that supports that interface can be instantiated. This provides for genericity
in structural specifications.</p>
<p class="reactive">Despite its additional restrictions, the state machine associated with a
capsule is modeled by the standard link between a UML Classifier and a State
Machine. The implementation/decomposition of a capsule is modeled by a standard
UML collaboration element that can be associated with a classifier.</p>
