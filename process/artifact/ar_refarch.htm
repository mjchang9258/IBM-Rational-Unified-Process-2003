<h3><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Reference Architecture artifacts are part of an organization's reusable asset
base. Their purpose is to form a starting point for architectural development.
They may range from ready-made <a href="../glossary.htm#architectural_pattern">architectural
patterns</a>, <a href="../glossary.htm#architectural_mechanism">architectural
mechanisms</a><i> </i>and <a href="../glossary.htm#framework">frameworks</a>,
to complete systems, with known characteristics, proven in use. They may be
applicable generally, or for a broad class of systems spanning domains, or have
a narrower, domain-specific, focus.</p>
<p>The use of tested reference architectures is
an effective way to address many non-functional requirements, particularly
quality requirements, by selecting existing reference architectures, which are
known through usage to satisfy those requirements. Reference Architectures may
exist or be used at different levels of abstraction and from different
viewpoints. These correspond to the 4+1 Views (see <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_swarch.htm#A Typical Set of Architectural Views">&quot;A
Typical Set of Architectural Views&quot;</a>). In this way, the software
architect can select what fits best&#151just architectural design, or design and
implementation, to varying degrees of completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Often, a Reference
Architecture is defined not to include instances of the components that will be
used to construct the system&#151if it does it becomes a <a href="../glossary.htm#product-line_architecture">Product-Line
Architecture</a>&#151but this is not a hard and fast distinction. In the
Rational Unified Process (RUP), we allow the notion of Reference Architecture to
include references to existing, reusable components (that is, implementations).</p>
<h3><a name="BriefOutline">Brief Outline</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<h4>Organization of Assets</h4>
<p>The organization which owns the Reference Architecture assets will need to
decide how the assets are to be classified and organized for easy retrieval by
the software architect, by matching selection criteria for the new system.
Although the creation and storage of Reference Architectures is currently
outside the scope of the RUP, one suggestion is that
architectures be organized around the idea of <a href="../glossary.htm#domain">domains</a>,
where a domain is a subject area that defines knowledge and concepts for some
aspect of a system, or for a family of systems. Here we are allowing use of the
term 'domain' at levels below that of the application. This usage differs
slightly from some definitions&#151for example, that presented in [<a href="../referenc.htm#HOF99">HOF99</a>]&#151but aligns well with that presented in [<a href="../referenc.htm#LMFS96">LMFS96</a>]:</p>
<p><i>&quot;<b>Product-Line Domain</b>: A bounded group of capabilities -
present and/or future - defined to facilitate communication, analysis and
engineering in pursuit of identifying, engineering and managing commonality
across a product-line. Such domains might include closely related groups of
end-user systems, commonly used functions across multiple systems, or widely
applicable groupings of underlying services.&quot;</i></p>
<p>This definition includes the notion that things used to compose systems may
themselves belong to a domain worthy of study in its own right. The figure
below, taken from [<a href="../referenc.htm#LMFS96">LMFS96</a>], illustrates
this principle.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/domains.gif" width="381" height="191"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Horizontal and Vertical Domains
for the US Army</b></p>
<p align="left">This figure shows the major system families, Information
Systems, Command &amp; Control, and Weapon Systems, each with some wholly
contained vertical domains, and horizontal domains that cut across these and
also across system families. Thus, Real-Time Scheduling concepts are applicable
to the Tactical Domain of Command &amp; Control and all vertical domains of
Weapon Systems. It probably makes sense therefore, to solve real-time scheduling
problems once for all these domains, and treat the knowledge and assets so
developed as a separate domain, which then has an association to, for example,
Electronic Warfare, but not to Personnel Information Systems.</p>
<h4 align="left">Contents</h4>
<p align="left">The Reference Architecture has the same form as the <a href="ar_sadoc.htm">Artifact: 
  Software Architecture Document</a> and the associated models, <i>stripped of 
  project specific references, or having project references and characteristics 
  made generic,</i> so that the Reference Architecture may be classified appropriately 
  in the asset base. Typical models associated with the Software Architecture 
  Document (SAD) are a Use-Case Model, Design Model, Implementation Model and 
  Deployment Model.</p>
<p align="left">Access to the SAD and associated models gives several points of
entry for the software architect, who could choose to use just the conceptual or
logical parts of the architecture (if the organization's reuse policy allows
this). At the other extreme, the software architect may be able to take from the
asset base complete working subsystems, and a Deployment Model at the physical
level (that is, a complete hardware and network blueprint).</p>
<p align="left">Other supporting artifacts are needed to make the architectural
assets usable.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">The Use-Case Model describes the behavior of the architecture 
      but the software architect will also need to know its non-functional qualities. 
      These two&#151the Use-Case Model and non-functional requirements&#151may 
      previously have been captured in a Software Requirements Specification. 
      From this the software architect will be able to determine how well the 
      Reference Architecture meets current requirements. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">The use, and more particularly, the modification of the architecture 
      will need the same guidance as the original development. For example, the 
      software architect will need to know what rules were applied in the formation 
      of the Reference Architecture, and how difficult it will be to modify interfaces. 
      Access to the design guidelines associated with the Reference Architecture 
      can help answer these questions. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">(Optional) Reviewing any relevant existing Test Plans may 
      also prove useful. These Test Plans will inform the architect of the test 
      and evaluation strategies previously used to test similar architectures, 
      and as such are likely to provide insight into potential weaknesses in the 
      architecture. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="left">(Optional) Reviewing any relevant existing Test Automation 
      Architectures and Test Interface Specifications may prove useful. These 
      artifacts inform the architect of likely requests that may be made of the 
      architecture to facilitate testing. 
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Timing">Timing</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Reference Architecture is used in inception and early elaboration during
architectural synthesis and the selection of a candidate architecture. The
creation of Reference Architectures is an organizational issue and currently
outside the scope of the RUP. During project close down,
the artifacts created during the project will be examined to see if anything can
be harvested and retained in the organization's asset base, but the activities
and techniques employed to do this are not elaborated here.</p>
<h3><a name="Responsibility">Responsibility</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The software architect is responsible for the selection and use of Reference
Architectures.</p>
<h3><a name="Tailoring">Tailoring</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unless the system is completely unprecedented, Reference Architectures should
be examined for applicability (to the domain and type of development) if they
exist and are accessible to the development organization. The <i>creation</i> of
Reference Architectures is an issue to be addressed at the organization level.
It's certainly possible to cut back on the contents list above and still achieve
some benefits from architectural reuse. For example, it is possible to omit the
test model, although tests would have to be rewritten if the architecture is
modified. At a minimum one might expect a design model and some associated
behavioral description (perhaps the Use-Case Model). Any less and it's difficult
to call the asset a Reference Architecture&#151;it could still be a valid pattern
(analysis, design, ...) of some kind.</p>
