<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A primary purpose of modeling business use cases and actors is to describe 
  how the business is used by its customers and partners. Activities that directly 
  concern the customer or partner, as well as supporting or managerial tasks that 
  indirectly concern the external party can be presented.</p>
<p>The model describes the business in terms of business use cases, which
correspond to what are generally called &quot;processes&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm1.gif"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Actors and use cases at the check-in counter.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a name="Different Categories of Business Use Cases">
Categories of Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>When looking at the activities in a business, you will be able to identify 
  at least three categories of work corresponding to three categories of business 
  use cases: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Core</b>—These are customer-facing business use cases that provide the 
    value chain—for example, Buy Product.</li>
  <li><b>Management</b>—These are internal business use cases that coordinate 
    the value chain—for example, Strategic Planning.</li>
  <li><b>Support</b>—These are internal business use cases that support the value 
    chain—for example, Procure Raw Materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, a management type of business use case describes in general the 
  relationships between the CEO and the people who work in the business use cases. 
  It also describes how business use cases are developed and instantiated (started).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm2.gif"></p>
<p class="picturetext">At a restaurant, the core business use cases are
marketing and serving dinner, and the supporting business use case is purchasing
supplies.</p>
<p>Note that what you regard as a core business use case can sometimes be a supporting 
  business use case in another business. For example, software development is 
  a core business use case in a software development company, but it would be 
  classified as a supporting business use case in a bank or an insurance company.</p>
<h3><a name="A Business has Many Business Use Cases">A Business Has Many Business 
  Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Instances of several different business use cases, as well as several instances 
  of a single business use case, normally execute in parallel. There might be 
  an almost unlimited number of paths a use-case instance can follow. These different 
  paths represent the choices open to the use-case instance in the workflow description. 
  Depending on specific events or facts, a use-case instance can proceed along 
  one of several possible paths; for example: 
<ul>
  <li>input from an actor</li>
  <li>a business rule</li>
</ul>
<p>In modeling business use cases, you can assume that use-case instances can 
  be active concurrently without conflicting. At this stage of business development, 
  you should focus on <b>what</b> the business should do. Solve potential resource 
  conflicts later, when modeling the business use-case realizations, at which 
  stage you try to understand <b>how</b> things should work in the business. Or 
  you can solve these problems during the implementation of the new organization 
  by increasing the number of employees who can perform the critical task.</p>
<h3><a name="Are Business Use Cases Always Related to Actors?">Are Business Use
Cases Always Related to Business Actors?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Every core business use case must have a communicates-relationship to or from 
  a business actor. This rule enforces the goal that businesses must be built 
  around the services that their users request. If your Business Use-Case Model 
  has business use cases that no one requests, this should warn you that something 
  is wrong with the model.</p>
<p>Business use cases can be triggered periodically, or they can run for a very 
  long time; a surveillance function is an example of the latter. Even these business 
  use cases have business actors that originally initiated them and expect different 
  services from them. Otherwise they would not be part of the business. Other 
  business use cases produce results for a business actor, although they are not 
  explicitly initiated by the business actor. For example, the development of 
  a widely distributed product is seldom initiated by an identifiable customer. 
  Instead, the need for a new product is realized from market studies and the 
  accumulated requests of many users.</p>
<p>Management and supporting business use cases do not necessarily need to connect 
  to a business actor, although they normally have some kind of external contact. 
  A management business use case, for instance, might have the business' owners 
  or the board as its business actor.</p>
<p>Abstract business use cases do not need a business actor, because they are 
  never instantiated (started) on their own.</p>
<h3><a name="Business Use Cases Should Support Business Goals">Business Use Cases 
  Must Support Business Goals</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business processes are the vehicle with which the business does things. Because 
  business strategy is very difficult to translate directly into actions, something 
  is else is needed. This something else is business goals, which ensure that 
  business processes execute the business strategy by steering actions at all 
  levels of the organization towards the ultimate business goal—the business idea.
<p>For this reason, each business use case should support at least one business 
  goal. Translating the strategy into goals at different levels provides concrete, 
  measurable objectives, which can be directly supported by business processes. 
  Defining supporting relationships between goals and processes ensures that the 
  business processes are aligned with the business strategy. This also helps find 
  the right level of business use cases, which is often difficult to determine. 
  Only one business use case (for example, Make Profit)<i> </i>that directly supports 
  the strategic goals of the enterprise would be too complex and cumbersome to 
  model as a sequence of activities. On the other hand, a separate business use 
  case for each individual operational task in the organization (for example, 
  Forward Telephone Call or Book Conference Room) would result in too many business 
  use cases to understand. Defining the business goals supported by a business 
  use case indicates whether the business use case is &quot;too high&quot; or 
  &quot;too low.&quot;&nbsp;
<p>When a business use case explicitly supports one or more business goals, it 
  becomes easier to quantify the value of the business use case. The contribution 
  of the result of the business use case toward the goal can be measured. The 
  performance of the business use case also can be monitored to provide an objective 
  comparison of value versus cost.
<p>The existence of these relationships helps in prioritizing business use cases. 
  Business use cases that support many business goals, or important and risky 
  ones, are most likely to be considered architecturally significant. Many goals 
  might also point to unnecessary complexity. If one business use case supports 
  many different goals, then it is quite likely that conflicts will arise. In 
  these cases, it may not be clear which goals should preside, resulting in inefficient 
  actions.
<p>The category of the business use case (core, supporting, or management) does 
  not directly determine the types of business goals it supports. While the category 
  does provide a guideline, the business strategy will ultimately determine which 
  business goals a particular business use case supports. For example, a Market 
  and Sell Product business use case might support the Competitive Prices business 
  goal for a business with an aggressive growth strategy. The same business, years 
  later, may wish to maximize its investment in these products and markets by 
  targeting customer satisfaction and retention. The Market and Sell Product business 
  use case may then have to support the (very different) Superior Quality business 
  goal. See <a href="md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: Business Goal</a> for more information 
  on modeling business goals.
<p>For example, consider the large furniture store used as an example in <a href="md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Goal</a>. A Business Use Case Model for such a furniture chain may 
  look as follows:
<p align="center"><img border="0"
src="images/bucm5.gif">
<p>The customer can select products, pick them up from the warehouse attached 
  to the showroom, and pay for them. Defect products can be returned. Identify 
  Customer Needs is the business use case that is often referred to as Market 
  Research. Once a suitable product has been found, it is launched, and the Vendor 
  then becomes a Supplier. Product sales must be monitored, although it is arguable 
  whether this a separate business use case (shown in the figure above) or part 
  of Market Research. If we were to map the above business use cases onto the 
  business goals described in <a href="md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: Business Goal</a>, 
  the following could result:
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm6.gif">
<p align="left">The Find Suitable Product business use case supports somewhat 
  conflicting business goals. It must be made clear how to make tradeoffs between 
  price and quality to ensure that both business goals are met. If product quality 
  is measured by the number (or percentage) of returned defects, the cause of 
  the defect must be established to trace it back to the supplier. For example, 
  it could be that many products delivered to customers are returned due to the 
  fact that they are damaged by the delivery team. However, if only the number 
  of deliveries is measured, the quality of deliveries is not revealed.
<p align="left">The Pay for Product business use case may support Payment Method 
  and not Low Pricing, because pricing is determined during the (separate) Find 
  Suitable Product Business use case.
<p align="left">In some companies, a number of business use cases support no business 
  goals. This may be a reason to merge Monitor Sales, for example, into Identify 
  Customer Need, because Monitor Sales does not directly support any business 
  goals. However, such merging should not be done too hastily, because a lack 
  of support for business goals can be a sign that the business goals need to 
  made more concrete. In the worst case, Monitor Sales provides input to Identify 
  Customer Needs. 
<p align="left">The Deliver Product business use case supports the Delivery Time 
  business goal. Customers should not have to wait too long for their purchased 
  products to be delivered. Considering how this goal can be achieved might provide 
  radical new ideas. For example, an underground tube could connect the warehouse 
  to houses in the city and products could be blasted at 100 mph through the tubes 
  to arrive at home before the customer does! While this is unrealistic, this 
  kind of brainstorming often generates many ideas for improving the business.
<p align="left">Here is an example of how considering business goals may reveal 
  the importance of seemingly trivial business use cases. Suppose it appears that 
  many customers shop during mealtimes. Because one of the business goals is to 
  improve the quality of facilities and another is to attract customers, we may 
  decide to provide a restaurant where customers can have a snack before or after 
  shopping. The business use case that supports this goal, Have Meal, is shown 
  below. It may turn out that the restaurant becomes one of the main attractions 
  of the business!
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm7.gif">
<p align="left">We also see the effect of adjusting the boundary of the business 
  in the diagram above. Here, a new business actor has been introduced—namely, 
  Shipper, a partner responsible for picking products up at the warehouse and 
  delivering them to customers. It could be that this approach allows us to minimize 
  the delivery time, which is one of the business goals. 
<h3><a name="Structuring the Business Use-Case Model">Structuring the Business
Use-Case Model</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There are three main reasons for structuring the Business Use-Case Model: 
<ul>
  <li>to make the business use cases easier to understand</li>
  <li>to reuse parts of workflows that are shared among many business use cases</li>
  <li>to make the Business Use-Case Model easier to maintain</li>
</ul>
<p>To structure the business use cases, we have three kinds of relationships. 
  You will use these relationships to factor out pieces of business use cases 
  that can be reused in other business use cases, or that are specializations 
  or options to the business use case. The business use case that represents the 
  modification is called the <b>addition use case</b>. The business use case that 
  is modified is called the <b>base use case</b>. 
<ul>
  <li>If there is a part of a base use case that represents a function of which
    the business use case only depends on the result, not the method used to
    produce the result, you can factor that part out to an addition use case.
    The addition is explicitly included in the base use case, using the
    include-relationship. See also <a href="md_bincl.htm">Guidelines:
    Include-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model</a>.</li>
  <li>If there is a part of a base use case that is optional, or not necessary
    to understand the primary purpose of the use case, you can factor that part
    out to an addition use case in order to simplify the structure of the base
    use case. The addition is implicitly included in the base use case, using
    the extend-relationship. See also <a href="md_bext.htm">Guidelines:
    Extend-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model</a>.</li>
  <li>If there are business use cases that have commonalities in behavior and 
    structure and that have similarities in purpose, their common parts can be 
    factored out to a base use case (parent) that is inherited by addition use 
    cases (children). The child use cases can insert new behavior and modify existing 
    behavior in the structure they inherit from the parent use case. See also 
    <a href="md_bucgn.htm">Guidelines: Use-Case-Generalization in the Business 
    Use-Case Model</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm3.gif"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The figure above shows actors and use cases and the check-in 
  counter. Here we also show the inclusion use case Baggage Handling and the extension 
  use case Through Check-In.</p>
<p>You can use actor-generalization to show how actors are specializations of
one another. See also <a href="md_bacg.htm">Guidelines: Actor-Generalization in
the Business Use-Case Model</a>.</p>
<p>See also the discussion on structuring system use cases in <a href="md_ucmod.htm">Guidelines:
Use-Case Model</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Delimiting the Modeling Effort">Delimiting the Modeling Effort</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Especially when developing business models just to &quot;prime the pump&quot; 
  for a software engineering project, you must carefully delimit the business-modeling 
  effort. In this case, it is rarely worthwhile to span the whole organization, 
  even if you model only a subset of the business processes. To stay focused and 
  produce results that are of the expected value, you should consider a part of 
  the whole company as your &quot;business system.&quot; The part you choose should 
  be the part that might directly use the system to be built. The parts of the 
  organization that you decide to treat as external to the model can be represented 
  as business actors.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">The company has decided to undertake an effort to build a new 
  application for sales and order management. To explore the needs of the organization 
  and also to align the way business is done throughout the organization, the 
  first step is to build a set of business models. The departments of the company 
  that will not actively use the new order application are considered external 
  to the model and are represented with business actors.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bucm4.gif"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The figure above shows business actors and business use 
  cases in a Business Use-Case Model of an order management organization. This 
  organization sells complex solutions, custom-made to each customer.</p>
<p class="example">Here are some brief descriptions of the business use cases:</p>
<p class="example"><b>Order Process—</b>This process describes how the company 
  takes appropriate actions to deliver a solution to a customer as defined by 
  a set of customer requirements. The process starts when there is a business 
  decision to proceed with an agreed-upon solution. This may often be in the form 
  of the company receiving a purchase order from a customer. It ends when the 
  customer is satisfied with the installment, and commission of the solution and 
  payment is received. The objective is to satisfy customer requirements in a 
  profitable way.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Proposal Process—</b>This is the process of generating a 
  proposal(s) in response to customer requirements. The process is triggered by 
  an inquiry from a customer and ends when the customer accepts (or rejects) any 
  of the quote(s) in the proposal. The objective is to reach agreement on a quote 
  that is acceptable both to the customer and to the company.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Quote Process—</b>The Quote Process is an abstract business 
  use case that is included in both the Proposal Process and the Order Process. 
  The process begins when there are customer requirements that need a quote produced 
  for it. The objective of the Quote Process is to produce a solution meeting 
  the customer requirements, and to provide it along with a price.</p>
<h3><a name="The Survey Description">The Survey Description</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A survey description of the Business Use-Case Model must: 
<ul>
  <li>summarize the purpose of the organization</li>
  <li>point out delimitations of the model—things that are not included and the 
    reasons why</li>
  <li>specify the primary business use cases</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">This Business Use-Case Model covers the part of our company 
  that manages orders from our customers, since only this part is of interest 
  to the software engineering project that will use the results of business modeling 
  as an input. For this reason, we do not include the parts of the company that 
  handles billing, manufacturing, product management, and product development; 
  they are considered external and therefore represented as business actors.</p>
<p class="example">In this organization, a sale involves not just the agreement 
  on a solution, but also the actual building of the solution. To define a price 
  for a solution, you need to engineer and build it to a certain level of detail. 
  That is what is done in the Proposal Process. Once an agreement has been made 
  with the customer, the solution is engineered in all details and then installed 
  at the customer site. This is what is described in the Order Process. Both the 
  Proposal Process and the Order Process include the abstract business use case 
  Quote Process.</p>

of a Good Business Use-Case Model</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Business use cases are aligned with the business strategy, as described by
    concrete business goals.</li>
  <li>Use cases conform to the business they describe.</li>
  <li>All use cases are found. Taken together, use cases perform all activities
    within the business.</li>
  <li>Every activity within the business should be included in at least one use
    case.</li>
  <li>There should be a balance between the number of use cases and the size of
    the use cases:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Few use cases make the model easier to understand.</li>
    <li>Many use cases may make the model difficult to understand.</li>
    <li>Large use cases may be complex and difficult to understand.</li>
    <li>Small use cases are often easy to understand. However, make sure that
      the use case describes a complete workflow that produces something of
      value for a customer.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Each use case must be unique. If the workflow is the same as or similar to
    another use case, it will be difficult to keep them synchronized later.
    Consider merging them into a single use case.</li>
  <li>The survey description of the Business Use-Case Model should give a good, 
    comprehensive picture of the organization.</li>
