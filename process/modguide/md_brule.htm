<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business rules are kinds of requirements on how the business, including its 
  business tools, must operate. They can be laws and regulations imposed on the 
  business but also express the chosen business architecture and style. There 
  are two ways of capturing business rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Model-based</b>—Business rules are captured as stereotyped constraints 
    in UML models. The rule can be declared using natural language or a more formal 
    notation, such as Object Constraint Language (OCL). The advantage of this 
    technique is that business rules are captured and displayed at the source 
    where they apply. The main disadvantage is that business rules are scattered 
    throughout the model, and it is therefore difficult to view related business 
    rules. The <a href="../reports/re_brules.htm">Report: Business Rules Survey</a> 
    provides an overview of all business rules in the model.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Document-based</b>—Business rules are captured in a separate document. 
    The document contains business rules, but these are not the business rules 
    used in the model-based approach. A document-based approach is useful when 
    large numbers of business rules apply (such as for financial products). A 
    disadvantage is that business rules are captured in a different artifact than 
    the source where they apply.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Capturing Business Rules">Capturing Business Rules</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business rules can be captured in both document and model form. If you want 
  to obtain an overview of business rules in models, you can generate a <a href="../reports/re_brules.htm">Report: 
  Business Rules Survey</a>.</p>
<p>A Business Rules Document is especially useful for business rules that have 
  long descriptions, such as legislation. The disadvantage of document-based business 
  rules is that it may still be necessary to trace the business rule to all parts 
  of the model where it applies (if more than one). This can be overcome by opting 
  for model-based business rules that can be captured directly in the models where 
  they apply. However, this has the disadvantage of being &quot;hidden away in 
  the model,&quot; and it is more difficult to obtain an overview of all business 
  rules that have some common characteristic (such as belonging to a particular 
  category).</p>
<h3><a name="Level of Formalism">Levels of Formalism</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business rules need to be rigorously and formally expressed so that they can 
  form a basis for automation. An alternative would be to use the Object Constraint 
  Language (OCL) as specified in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [<a href="../referenc.htm#RUM98">RUM98</a>].&nbsp; 
  Always consider who will be reading the business rules. Focusing on the reader 
  helps ensure that the manner in which you capture the business rules (documents 
  or models), your selected style, and level of formalism match the target audience. 
  Business rules that cannot be understood by those who must read them are a waste 
  of time on any project.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">You may want to express a limit to the size of a team to less 
  than ten members. With the OCL, you can state this business rule as an invariant:</p>
<p class="example"><font face="Courier New"><b>context</b> Team <b>inv</b>:</font></p>
<p class="example"><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
self.numberOfMembers &lt;= 10</font></p>
<p>However, you must consider that this formal type of language may be difficult 
  to interpret for many of your stakeholders, so a more natural language style 
  might be preferable. You can define a set of reserved expressions that you use 
  to define the rules. Those expressions could be the same as those defined in 
  [<a href="../referenc.htm#ODL98">ODL98</a>]:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>IF</li>
  <li>ONLY IF</li>
  <li>WHEN</li>
  <li>THEN</li>
  <li>ELSE</li>
  <li>IT MUST ALWAYS HOLD THAT</li>
  <li>IS CORRECTLY COMPLETED</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">In this less formal language, the example above reads:</p>
<p class="example">IT MUST ALWAYS HOLD THAT the number of team members is less
or equal to 10.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Categories of Business Rules">Categories of Business Rules</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Rules can be classified in many ways, although it is common is to divide them 
  between constraint rules and derivation rules. [<a href="../referenc.htm#ODL98">ODL98</a>] 
  Both categories can be further subdivided in the following manner:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Constraint rules </b>specify policies or conditions that restrict object 
    structure and behavior.&nbsp;Constraint rules may <i>always</i> apply, or 
    they may apply <i>only under certain conditions</i>. Constraints that always 
    apply are referred to as<b> invariants</b>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Stimulus and response rules</b> constrain behavior by specifying when and
      if conditions must be true in order for behavior to be
      triggered.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Operation constraint rules</b> specify those conditions that must
      hold true before and after an operation to ensure that the operation performs
      correctly.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Structure constraint rules</b> specify policies or conditions about
      classes, objects, and their relationships that should not be
      violated.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Derivation rules</b> specify policies or conditions for inferring or
    computing facts from other facts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Inference rules</b> specify that if certain facts are true, a
      conclusion can be inferred.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Computation rules</b> derive their results by way of processing algorithms,
      a more sophisticated variant of inference rules.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This classification of business rules is practical when explaining what business 
  rules are, how to find them, and how to work with them. However, there is no 
  need to think of them as fixed groupings to which you always need refer. Therefore, 
  our template for the business rules artifact does not show this classification—in 
  your project most likely there will be other groupings (by domain, by user, 
  or by product group) that are much more valuable to show. For more information 
  about classifying and applying business rules, see [<a href="../referenc.htm#ROS97">ROS97</a>].</p>
<h3><a name="How Business Rules are Reflected in the Models">How Business Rules 
  Are Reflected in the Models</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A business rule affects how your models look. It can also affect how you sequence 
  activities in your activity diagram, and it may even affect what associations 
  you have between your business entities. Some rules are not easy to straightforwardly 
  translate to the way a diagram looks—they may need to reside in the descriptions 
  of the model elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business rules in a UML diagram should be linked to the model element they
affect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also useful to track business rules in the <a href="../artifact/ar_rattr.htm">Requirements 
  Attributes</a> for traceability and reporting purposes.</p>
<h4>Stimulus and Response Rules</h4>
<p>This kind of business rule affects the workflow of a business use case and 
  can be traced to the business use case to which it applies. You might either 
  show a conditional path or an alternative path through the workflow. If the 
  actions involved are less significant, it can be sufficient to let the evaluation 
  of the business rule be enclosed in an activity state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Business Analysis Model, a rule of this kind could, for example, affect 
  how you describe the lifecycle a business entity, or it could be part of the 
  description of an operation on a business worker.&nbsp;Examining the identified 
  business events is a very useful source for defining these kinds of business 
  rules. Usually a business event is identified because somebody or something 
  is interested in the occurrence of the event. Ask the question, &quot;What conditions 
  or behavior applies once the event occurs?&quot;</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">In an order management organization, you might find the following 
  rule:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">WHEN an Order is canceled</p>
  <p class="example">IF Order is not shipped</p>
  <p class="example">THEN close Order.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">This business rule is reflected by showing two alternative 
  paths in a workflow and specifically using a decision and guard condition on 
  outgoing transitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_bru1.gif" width="417" height="395"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The business rule in this case translates to an alternative 
  path through the workflow.</p>
<h4>Operation Constraint Rules</h4>
<p>This type of business rule often translates to preconditions and post-conditions 
  of a workflow, or to a conditional or alternative path in a workflow.&nbsp;It 
  can also be a performance goal or some other non-behavioral rule that should 
  be traced to the business use cases to which it applies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">In an order management organization, you might find the following 
  rule:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">Ship Order to Customer</p>
  <p class="example">ONLY IF Customer has a shipping address.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_bru2.gif" width="428" height="378"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The business rule translates to an alternative path in 
  the workflow.</p>
<p class="picturetext">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">Here is another operation constraint rule:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">IT MUST ALWAYS HOLD THAT</p>
  <p class="example">All customer
    inquiries must be responded to within 24 hours of their receipt</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">This business rule would translate to a performance goal of 
  a business use case. See the section on performance goal in <a href="md_buc.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Use Case</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Structure Constraint Rules</h4>
<p>This type of business rule affects relations between instances of business 
  entities. They are expressed by the existence of an association between two 
  business entities, sometimes as a multiplicity on the association. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">In an order management organization, you might find the following 
  rule:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">IT MUST ALWAYS HOLD THAT</p>
  <p class="example">an Order refers to at least 1 Product.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_bru3.gif" width="360" height="115"></p>
<p class="picturetext">This business rule translates to an association with the
multiplicity of 1..*.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Inference Rules</h4>
<p>Inference rules often seem similar to stimulus and response, as well as to 
  operation constraint or structure constraint types of rules. The difference 
  is that there are a few steps that need to be thought through to arrive at the 
  conclusion. The rule implies a method that needs to be reflected in an activity 
  state of the workflow and eventually in an operation on a business worker or 
  business entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">You might set up the following rule to determine a customer’s 
  status:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">A Customer is a Good Customer IF AND ONLY IF</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="example">the unpaid invoices sent to this Customer are less than
    30 days old.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_bru4.gif" width="613" height="524"></p>
<p class="picturetext">This business rule corresponds to an alternative path through 
  the workflow, and the method prescribed will be part of the Evaluate Customer 
  activity.</p>
<h4>Computation Rules</h4>
<p>Computation rules are similar to inference rules. The difference is that the 
  method is more formal and looks like an algorithm. As with inference rules, 
  this method needs to be traced to an activity in the workflow and, eventually, 
  to an operation on a business worker or a business entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="example">A computation rule can specify value computation:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">The net price of a Product IS COMPUTED AS FOLLOWS</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="example">product price * (1+tax percentage/100).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">Evaluating the net price could be part of the activity Ship 
  Order as you produce the bill sent with the order. In the Business Analysis 
  Model, this rule translates to associations and operations.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_bru5.gif" width="496" height="266"> 
      
<p class="picturetext">The rule needs to be reflected as a method in the operation 
  Calculate Net Price but also implies a need for relationships between classes 
  in the model.
