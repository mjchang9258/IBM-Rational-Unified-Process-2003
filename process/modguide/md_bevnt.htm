</h3>
<p>Business events represent important occurrences in the day-to-day activities 
  of the business. Of course, there are thousands of things happening in and around 
  any business each day. Business events allow us to manage complexity by focusing 
  attention on what is really important, and in this sense they are architecturally 
  significant. Business events have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	
  <li>They represent an occurrence of significance, i.e., they are nontrivial.</li>
  <li>They appear to occur at random, or at least unpredictably.</li>
	
  <li>They occur independently of one another.</li>
	
  <li>They result in some immediate action by the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>A business event that does not have one of these characteristics is suspect.</p>
<p>Business events are triggered and received by business actors, business workers, 
  and business entities, while interacting to realize a business use. Business 
  events can be triggered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By business actors to indicate the start or end of a business use case. 
    For example, when a supplier delivers goods, a Delivery business event would 
    indicate the start of the Deliver Goods business use case.</li>
  <li>By business entities to indicate a change of state. For example, as part 
    of the Recruit Employees business use case, a CandidateQualified business 
    event would indicate that the references of a potential employee have been 
    checked.</li>
  <li>By business workers to indicate a specific point within a business use-case 
    realization. For example, once a rocket has been launched, a Launch business 
    event would indicate that tracking the trajectory of the rocket can start.</li>
  <li>By the elapse of time. For example, six hours after a patient has come out 
    of the operating room, a PatientCoherent business event would indicate that 
    a nurse should go and check up on the patient.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Modeling Business Events"></a>Modeling Business Events
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20" alt="To top of page"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Business events can contain information that provides more context about the 
  occurrence the event represents. This information is modeled as attributes of 
  the business event class, as shown in the figure. The attributes of a business 
  event can be determined by considering what information the receivers of the 
  event require in order to take action.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt1.gif" width="230" height="121"></p>

<p>Business events that represent changes in the state of business entities should 
  have an association to the business entity to which they relate, as shown in 
  the figure. This allows receivers of the business event to access the business 
  entity in question and retrieve the necessary information.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt2.gif" width="393" height="106"></p>

<p>Business actors, business workers, and business entities can both trigger and 
  receive business events. The class that triggers a business event is called 
  a <b>publisher</b>, while the class that receives a business event is called 
  a <b>subscriber</b>.</p>

<p>A publisher requires a &laquo;send&raquo; stereotyped dependency to the business 
  events it will trigger, as shown in the figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt3.gif" width="348" height="122"></p>
<p>A subscriber requires an operation stereotyped &laquo;business event&raquo; 
  with the same name as the business event and parameters that match the attributes 
  of the business event, as shown in the figure. Take note that the operation 
  signature needs to be kept consistent with the business event name and attributes.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt4.gif" width="522" height="292"></p>
<p>An alternative approach is to invent a &laquo;receive&raquo; stereotyped dependency 
  from the subscriber to the business event, although this is not standard UML. 
  The operation signatures can be deduced from all the &laquo;receive&raquo; dependencies. 
  An example of this nonstandard approach is shown in the figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt5.gif" width="465" height="109"></p>
<p>Actual triggering of business events is shown in either interaction or activity 
  diagrams. In interaction diagrams, the publisher sends an asynchronous message 
  to the receiver, with the name of the business event. An example of this is 
  shown in the figure. Note that the message is asynchronous. This indicates that 
  the publisher does not wait for the subscriber to finish processing the business 
  event before continuing. Rather, the publisher triggers the business event and 
  continues directly with whatever it was doing. The subscriber in turn starts 
  processing the business events as soon as it is received. This represents real 
  life more closely than synchronous messages.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt6.gif" width="442" height="272"></p>
<p>In activity diagrams, the publisher is shown to trigger the business event. 
  The receiver is shown to receive the business event, either in the same diagram 
  or in another diagram. An example of this is shown in the figure.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt7.gif" width="617" height="382"></p>

<h3><a name="Finding Business Events"></a>Finding Business
Events<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20" alt="To top of page"></a> 
</h3>

<p>When an association between a business actor and a business use case is
named, a corresponding business event can be used to signal when the business
use case is initiated, which would be a significant occurrence for the business.</p>
<p>Analyze the interactions between business workers in sequence diagrams. For each message between business workers,
consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location—Messages passed between two business workers at different locations 
    are candidate business events.</li>
  <li>Time—Messages in which there is a significant time difference between triggering 
    and receiving are candidate business events.</li>
  <li>Purpose—Messages that result in actions that have a different purpose in 
    relation to the actions that triggered the business event are candidate business 
    events.</li>
  <li>Responsibility—Messages that are performed by a business worker with different 
    responsibilities are candidate business events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analyzing the boundaries of the business systems helps to identify differences in purpose or
responsibility.</p>
<p>In activity diagrams, consider whether some action is required directly before or after each activity, or
whether some party must be notified of the outcome of a decision point.</p>
<p>Business entities also provide clues for business events. Any significant
operations of a business entity are candidate business events. Statechart
diagrams for business entities are very useful. State transitions
indicate potential business events because they may represent a change of state of the business.</p>

<p> When identifying business events, it is useful to imagine a paper office in 
  which the business entities are dossiers, and clerks read and change the dossiers 
  and carry them around between inboxes and outboxes. As soon as part of a dossier 
  needs to be duplicated in full so that it can be routed to different destinations, 
  you may have discovered a business event—there are multiple recipients. Also, 
  when a business worker must write a notice after performing a task, with the 
  purpose of informing somebody else, that task may also qualify as a business 
  event. Of course the dossiers do not lie around on desks the whole day—they 
  are filed. When it is necessary to remove a dossier from the filing cabinet 
  or to place a dossier back into the filing cabinet, consider what led up to 
  the need to remove or return the dossier. The occurrence that led up to, or 
  triggered, the need to remove or return a dossier may be a business event.</p>
<h3><a name="Generalization of Business Events"></a>Generalization of Business
Events <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20" alt="To top of page"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Business events may be categorized or grouped into &quot;families&quot; of 
  events by defining generalization relationships between more generalized and 
  more specialized business events. This allows more than one type of business 
  event to be treated in the same way by parties not interested in the different 
  subtypes of business events.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bevnt8.gif" width="367" height="214"></p>
<p align="left">The diagram above shows that the Sickness, Missing, and Death 
  of employees are all more specialized versions of the absence of an employee. 
  Defining the super-type Absence allows any one of the three subtypes to be treated 
  as an absence. In a consulting firm, for example, the account manager might 
  need to inform the customer that an employee is absent and arrange for a replacement, 
  irrespective of the reason for the employee's absence. The account manager is 
  therefore interested only in the business event Absence. The receptionist, on 
  the other hand, might need to undertake specific action if an employee becomes 
  ill, such as call a doctor or send flowers. The human resources manager and 
  the employee's manager might need to be informed if the employee has passed 
  away.</p>
<p align="left">In this example, we see that specializations of business events
are useful when different parties need to undertake different actions in
response to different (specific) circumstances. Generalizations of business
events are useful when certain parties need to respond in the same way to
certain business events, irrespective of the specific circumstances.</p>
<p align="left">In practice, of course, the party will probably be notified of 
  the actual (specialized) event. If an employee has passed away, you can be sure 
  that the account manager will also be informed of this, but the action undertaken 
  will be the same. Business event hierarchies do help to create a simpler, more 
  understandable Business Analysis Model.</p>
<h3><a name="Automation of Business Events"></a>Automation of Business Events <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" border="0" width="26" height="20" alt="To top of page"></a> 
</h3>

<p>It makes sense to automate the definition, triggering, and propagation of business 
  events, but this is not always practical. Sometimes it costs more to build a 
  system that does this than it takes to send an e-mail to a colleague. Some issues 
  that must be considered when contemplating the automation of business events 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the cost of purchasing or implementing and maintaining a system that automates 
    aspects of event management</li>
  <li>the technical feasibility of an automated solution</li>
  <li>the cost of non-automated alternatives</li>
  <li>the impact of not triggering or receiving certain events</li>
  <li>the possibility that certain events may cross business boundaries in future</li>
  <li>the currently available notification channels</li>
</ul>
<p>In a service-oriented architecture, messages are used to decouple software 
  systems from each other and from physical locations. Asynchronous messages can 
  also be used to decouple software systems in time. Business events will be implemented 
  as messages in these types of software systems, although certainly not all messages 
  will have an associated business event. A very useful application of business 
  events is in Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). Here each application 
  defines a number of business events to which other applications can subscribe. 
  This allows applications to interact without directly interacting.</p>
<p>For example, consider an insurance company that has one front-office system 
  for managing customer interactions, proposals, and contracts. It has a back-office 
  system for administering products and policies. When a customer requests a proposal, 
  the front-office system collects the necessary information about the customer 
  and insured object. Then the product administration system calculates premiums 
  based on the information and produces a preliminary insurance policy that is 
  linked to a proposal. Once the customer accepts the proposal, the policy administration 
  system must finalize the policy. In this example, there are two messages that 
  are disconnected in time, location, and responsibility—CalculatePremiums and 
  FinalizePolicy. However, only FinalizePolicy would be modeled as a business 
  event, because it has some significance outside of the current context.</p>
