<p>State machines are used to model the dynamic behavior of a model element, and
more specifically, the event-driven aspects of the system's behavior (see <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_event.htm">Concepts:
Events and Signals</a>). State machines are specifically used to define
state-dependent behavior, or behavior that varies depending on the state in
which the model element is in. Model elements whose behavior does not vary with
its state of the element do not require state machines to describe their
behavior (these elements are typically passive classes whose primary responsible
is to manage data). In particular, state machines must be used to model the
behavior of active classes that use call events and signal events to implement
their operations (as transitions in the class's state machine).</p>
<p>A state machine consists of states, linked by transitions. A state is a
condition of an object in which it performs some activity or waits for an event.
A transition is a relationship between two states which is triggered by some
event, which performs certain actions or evaluations, and which results in a
specific end-state. The elements of a state machine are depicted in Figure 1.</p>

<p>As depicted in Figure 1, there are two special states that may be defined for
an object's state machine. The initial state indicates the default starting
place for the state machine or substate. An initial state is depicted as a
filled black circle. The final state indicates the completion of the execution
of the state machine or that the enclosing state has been completed. A final
state is represented as a filled black circle surrounded by an unfilled circle.
Initial and final states are really pseudostates. Neither may have the usual
parts of a normal state, except for a name. A transition from an initial state
to a final state may have the full complement of features, including a guard
condition and an action, but may not have a trigger event.</p>

<p>A transition is a relationship between two states indicating that an object
in the first state will perform certain actions and enter a second state when a
specified event occurs and specified conditions are satisfied. On such a change
of state, the transition is said to 'fire'. Until the transition fires, the
object is said to be in the 'source' state; after it fires, it is said to be in
the 'target' state. A transition has several properties:</p>

<br></div>

<p>A transition may have multiple sources, in which case it represents a join
from multiple concurrent states, as well as multiple targets, in which case it
represents a fork to multiple concurrent states.</p>
<h4><a name="Event Triggers">Event Triggers</a></h4>
<p>In the context of the state machine, an event is an occurrence of a stimulus
that can trigger a state transition. Events may include signal events, call
events, the
passing of time, or a change in state. A signal or call may have parameters
whose values are available to the transition, including expressions for the
guard conditions and action. It is also possible to have a triggerless
transition, represented by a transition with no event trigger. These
transitions, also called completion transitions, is triggered implicitly when
its source state has completed its activity.</p>
<h4><a name="Guard Conditions">Guard Conditions</a></h4>
<p>A guard condition is evaluated after the trigger event for the transition
occurs. It is possible to have multiple transitions from the same source state
and with the same event trigger, as long as the guard conditions don't overlap.
A guard condition is evaluated just once for the transition at the time the
event occurs. The boolean expression may reference the state of the object.</p>
<h4><a name="Actions">Actions</a></h4>
<p>An action is an executable atomic computation, meaning that it cannot be
interrupted by an event and therefore runs to completion. This is in contrast to
an activity, which may be interrupted by other events. Actions may include
operation calls (to the owner of the state machine as well as other visible
objects), the creation or destruction of another object, or the sending of a
signal to another object. In the case of sending a signal, the signal name is
prefixed with the keyword 'send'.</p>
<h4><a name="Entry and Exit Actions">Entry and Exit Actions</a></h4>
<p>Entry and exit actions allow the same action to be dispatched every time the
state is entered or left, respectively. Entry and exit actions enable this to be
done cleanly, without having to explicitly put the actions on every incoming or
outgoing transition explicitly. Entry and exit actions may not have arguments or
guard conditions. The entry actions at the top-level of a state machine for a
model element may have parameters representing the arguments that the machine
receives when the element is created.</p>
<h4><a name="Internal Transitions">Internal Transitions</a></h4>
<p>Internal transitions allow events to be handled within the state without
leaving the state, thereby avoiding triggering entry or exit actions. Internal
transitions may have events with parameters and guard conditions, and
essentially represent interrupt-handlers.</p>
<h4><a name="Deferred Events">Deferred Events</a></h4>
<p>Deferred events are those whose handling is postponed until a state in which
the event is not deferred becomes active. When this state becomes active, the
event occurrence is triggered and may cause transitions as if it had just
occurred. The implementation of deferred events requires the presence of an
internal queue of events. If an event occurs but is listed as deferred, it is
queued. Events are taken off this queue as soon as the object enters a state
that does not defer these events.</p>
<h3><a name="Substates">Substates</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A simple state is one which has no substructure. A state which has substates
(nested states) is called a composite state. Substates may be nested to any
level. A nested state machine may have at most one initial state and one final
state. Substates are used to simplify complex flat state machines by showing
that some states are only possible within a particular context (the enclosing
state).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/md_state2.gif" alt="ar_state2.gif (12801 bytes)" width="449" height="279"></p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext">Figure 3. Substates.</p>
<p>From a source outside an enclosing composite state, a transition may target
the composite state or it may target a substate. If its target is the composite
state, the nested state machine must include an initial state, to which control
passes after entering the composite state and after dispatching its entry action
(if any). If its target is the nested state, control passes to the nested state
after dispatching the entry action of the composite state (if any), and then the
entry action of the nested state (if any).</p>
<p>A transition leading out of a composite state may have as its source the
composite state or a substate. In either case, control first leaves the nested
state (and its exit action, if any, is dispatched), then it leaves the composite
state (and its exit action, if any, is dispatched). A transition whose source is
the composite state essentially interrupts the activity of the nested state
machine.</p>
<h3><a name="History States">History States</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, when a transition enters a composite state, the
action of the nested state machine starts over again at the initial state
(unless the transition targets a substate directly). History states allow the
state machine to re-enter the last substate that was active prior to leaving the
composite state. An example of history state usage is presented in Figure 3.</p>

<h3><a name="Common Modeling Techniques">Common Modeling Techniques</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>State machines are used most commonly to model the behavior of an object
across its lifetime. They are particularly needed when objects have
state-dependent behavior. Objects which may have state machines include classes,
subsystems, use cases and interfaces (to assert states which must be satisfied by
an object which realizes the interface).</p>

<p class="reactive">In the case of real-time systems, state machines are also
used for capsules and protocols (to assert states which
must be satisfied by an object which realizes the protocol).</p>

<p> Not all objects
require state machines. If an object's behavior is simple, such that it simply
store or retrieves data, the behavior of the object is state-invariant and its
state machine is of little interest.</p>
<p>Modeling the lifetime of an object involves three things: specifying the
events to which the object can respond, the response to those events, and the
impact of the past on current behavior. Modeling the lifetime of an object also
involves deciding the order in which the object can meaningfully respond to
events, starting at the time of the object's creation and continuing until its
destruction.</p>
<p>To model the lifetime of an object:
<ul>
  <li>Set the context for the state machine, whether it is a class, a use case,
    or the system as a whole.
    <ul>
      <li>If the context is a class or a use case, collect the neighboring
        classes, including parent classes or classes reachable by associations
        or dependencies. These neighbors are candidate targets for actions and
        are candidate targets for inclusion in guard conditions.</li>
      <li>If the context is the system as a whole, narrow your focus to one
        behavior of the system, and then consider the lifetimes of the objects
        involved in that aspect. The lifetime of the entire system is simply too
        big too be a meaningful focus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Establish initial and final states for the object. If there are
    preconditions or postconditions of the initial and final states, define
    those as well.</li>
  <li>Determine the events to which the object responds. These can be found in
    the object's interfaces. In the case of real-time
    systems, these can be found in the object's protocols.</li>
  <li>Starting from the initial state to the final state, lay-out the top-level
    states the object may be in. Connect these states with transitions triggered
    by the appropriate events. Continue by adding these transitions.</li>
  <li>Identify any entry or exit actions.</li>
  <li>Expand or simplify the state machine by using substates.</li>
  <li>Check that all events triggering transitions in the state machine match
    events expected by the interfaces realized by the object.
    Similarly, check that all events expected by the interfaces of
    the object are handled by the state machine. In the case of real-time systems, make equivalent checks for a capsule's protocols. Finally, look to places where

    you explicitly want to ignore events (e.g. deferred events).</li>
  <li>Check that all actions in the state machine are supported by
    relationships, methods, and operations of the enclosing object.</li>
  <li>Trace through the state machine, comparing it with expected sequences of
    events and their responses. Search for unreachable states and states in
    which the machine gets stuck.</li>
  <li>If you re-arrange or re-structure the state machine, check to make sure
    that the semantics have not changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Hints and Tips">Hints and Tips</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>When given a choice, use the visual semantics of the state machine rather
    than writing detail transition code. For example, do not trigger one
    transition on several signals, then use detail code to manage the flow of
    control differently depending on the signal. Use separate transitions,
    triggered by separate signals. Avoid conditional logic in transition code
    that hides additional behavior.</li>
  <li>Name states according to what you are waiting for or what is happening
    during the state. Remember that a state is not a 'point in time'; it's a
    period during which the state machine is waiting for something to happen.
    For example, 'waitingForEnd' is a better name than 'end'; 'timingSomeActivity'
    is better than 'timeout'. Do not name states as if they were actions.</li>
  <li>Name all states and transitions within a state machine uniquely; this will
    make source-level debugging easier.</li>
  <li>Use state variables (attributes used to control behavior) cautiously; do not use them in lieu of creating new
    states. Where states are few, with little or no state-dependent behavior,
    and where there is little or no behavior that might be concurrent with or
    independent of the object containing the state machine, state variables may
    be used. If there is complex, state-dependent behavior which is potentially
    concurrent, or if events which must be handled may originate outside the
    object containing the state machine, consider using a collaboration of two
    or more active objects (possibly defined as a composition).  In
    real-time systems, complex&nbsp; state-dependent, concurrent behavior should
    be modeled using a capsule containing subcapsules. 
</li>
  <li>If there are more than 5 ± 2 states on a single diagram, consider using
    substates. Common sense applies: ten states in an absolutely regular pattern
    might be fine, but two states with forty transitions between them obviously
    needs to be re-thought. Make sure the state machine is understandable.</li>
  <li>Name transitions for what triggers the event and/or what happens during
    the transition. Choose names that improve understandability.</li>
  <li>When you see a choice vertex, you should ask whether you can delegate the
    responsibility for that choice to another component, such that it gets
    presented to the object as a distinct set of signals to be acted upon
    (e.g., instead of a choice on msg-&gt;data &gt; x), have the sender or some
    other intermediate actor make the decision and send a signal with the
    decision explicit in the signal name (e.g., use signals named isFull and
    isEmpty instead of having a signal named value and checking message data).</li>
  <li>Name the question answered at the choice vertex descriptively, e.g. 'isThereStillLife'
    or 'isItTimeToComplain'.</li>
  <li>Within any given object, try to keep choice vertex names unique (for the
    same reason as keeping transition names unique).</li>
  <li>Are there overly long code fragments on transitions? Should functions be
    used instead, and are common code fragments captured as functions? A
    transition should read like high-level pseudo-code, and should adhere to the
    same or even more stringent rules of length as C++ functions. For example, a
    transition with more than 25 lines of code is considered excessively long.</li>
  <li>Functions should be named by what they do.</li>
  <li>Pay particular attention to entry and exit actions: it is particularly
    easy to make changes and forget to change the entry and exit actions.</li>
  <li>Exit actions can be used to provide safety features, e.g. the exit action
    from the 'heaterOn' state turns the heater off, where the actions are used
    to enforce an assertion.</li>
  <li>Generally substates should contain two or more states unless the state
    machine is abstract and will be refined by sub-classes of the enclosing
    element.</li>
  <li>Choice points should be used in lieu of conditional logic in actions or
    transitions. Choice point are easily seen, whereas conditional logic in code
    is hidden from view and easy to overlook.</li>
  <li>Avoid guard conditions
    <ul>
      <li>If the event triggers several transitions, there is no control over
        which guard condition is evaluated first. As a result, results can be
        unpredictable.</li>
      <li>More than one guard condition could be 'true', but only one transition
        can be followed. The path chosen can be unpredictable.</li>
      <li>Guard conditions are non-visual; it is harder to 'see' their presence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid state machines which resemble flow charts.
    <ul>
      <li>This may indicate an attempt to model an abstraction that is not really 
        there, such as:
<ul>
          <li>using an active class to model behavior that is best suited for 
            a passive (or data) class or</li>
          <li>modeling a data class by using a data class and an active class 
            that are very tightly coupled (i.e. the data class was used for passing 
            type information around but the active class contains most of the 
            data that should be associated with the data class).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This misuse of state machines can be recognized by the following symptoms:
<ul>
          <li>messages sent to 'self', primarily just to re-use code</li>
          <li>few states, with many choice points</li>
          <li>in some cases a state machine without cycles. Such state machines 
            are valid in process control applications or when trying to control 
            a sequence of events; their presence during analysis usually represents 
            the degeneration of the state machine into a flow chart.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When the problem is identified:
<ul>
          <li>Consider splitting the active class into smaller units with more 
            distinct responsibilities,</li>
          <li>Move more behavior into a data class that is associated with the 
            problem active class.</li>
          <li>Move more behavior into active class functions.</li>
          <li>Make more meaningful signals instead of relying on data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Abstract State Machines </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p align="JUSTIFY">An abstract state machine is a state machine
that needs to have more detail added before it can be used for practical
purposes. Abstract state machines can be used to define generic, reusable
behavior which is further refined in subsequent model elements.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/md_cpsl2.gif" width="167" height="201"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Figure 5. An abstract state machine.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Consider the abstract state machine in Figure
5. The simple state machine depicted is representative of the
most abstract level of behavior (the &quot;control&quot; automaton) of many
different types of elements in event-driven systems. Although they all share this
high-level form, the different element types may have widely different detailed
behaviors in the Running state depending on their purpose. Therefore, this state
machine would most likely be defined in some abstract class that serves
as the root class for the different specialized active classes</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us therefore define two such different refinements of
this abstract state machine, using inheritance. These two refinements, R1 and
R2, are shown in Figure 6. For clarity, we have drawn the elements inherited
from the parent class using a gray pen.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/md_cpsl3.gif" width="391" height="204"></p>
<p align="CENTER">Figure 6. Two refinements of the state machine in Figure 5.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The two refinements clearly differ in how they
decompose the Running state and also how they extend the original
&quot;start&quot; transition. These choices can only be made, of course, once
the refinement is known and, hence, could not have been done with a single
end-to-end transition in the abstract class.</p>

<h3 align="JUSTIFY"><a name="Chain States">Chain States</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<font size="3">
<p align="JUSTIFY">The ability to &quot;continue&quot; both incoming transitions
and outgoing transitions is fundamental for the type of refinement described
above. It may seem that entry points and final states, combined with
continuation transitions are sufficient to provide these semantics.
Unfortunately, this is not sufficient when there are multiple different
transitions that need to be extended.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What is required for the abstract behavior pattern is a way
of chaining two or more transition segments that are all executed in the scope
of a single run-to-completion step. This means that transitions entering a
hierarchical state are split into the incoming part that effectively terminates
on the state boundary and an extension that continues within the state.
Similarly, outgoing transitions emanating from a hierarchically nested state are
segmented into a part that terminates on the enclosing state boundary and a part
that continues from the state boundary to the target state. This effect can be
achieved in UML with the introduction the <b>chain state</b> concept.
This is modeled by a stereotype (&laquo;chainState&raquo;) of the UML State concept. This
is a state whose only purpose is to &quot;chain&quot; further automatic (triggerless)
transitions onto an input transition. A chain state has no internal structure&#151;no
entry action, no internal activity, no exit action. It also has no transitions
triggered by events. It may have any number of input transitions. It may have an
outgoing transition with no trigger event; this transition automatically fires
when an input transition activates the state. The purpose of the state is to
chain an input transition to a separate output transition. Between the input
transition(s) and the chained output transition, one connects to another state
inside the containing state and the other connects to another state outside the
containing state. The purpose of introducing a chain state is to separate the
internal specification of the containing state from its external environment; it
is a matter of encapsulation.</p></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In effect, a chain state represents a &quot;pass
through&quot; state that serves to chain a transition to a specific continuation
transition. If no continuation transition is defined, then the transition
terminates in the chain state, and some transition on an enclosing state must
eventually fire to move things along.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The example state machine segment in Figure 7 illustrates
chain states and their notation. Chain states are represented in a state machine
diagram by small white circles located within the appropriate hierarchical state
(this notation is similar to initial and final states, which they resemble). The
circles are stereotype icons of the chain state stereotype and are usually drawn
near to the boundary for convenience. (In fact, a notational variation would be
to draw these on the border of the enclosing state.)</p>

<p class="picturetext">Figure 7. Chain states and chained transitions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The chained transition in this example consists of the three
chained transition segments e1/a11–/a12–/a13. When signal e1 is received,
the transition labeled e1/a11 is taken, its action a11 executed, and then chain
state c1 is reached. After that, the continuation transition between c1 and c2
is taken, and finally, since c2 is also a chain state, the transition from c2 to
S21. If the states along these paths all have exit and entry actions, the actual
sequence of action executions proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exit action of S11</li>
  <li>action a11</li>
  <li>exit action of S1</li>
  <li>action a12</li>
  <li>entry action of S2</li>
  <li>action a13</li>
  <li>entry action of S21</li>
</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All of this is executed in the scope of a single
run-to-completion step.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This should be compared against the action execution
semantics of the direct transition e2/a2, which are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exit action of S11</li>
  <li>exit action of S1</li>
  <li>action a2</li>
  <li>entry action for state S2</li>
  <li>entry action for state S21</li>
</ul>
