<p><a name="XE_design_subsystem__packages_vs._subsystems"></a><a name="XE_design_package__subsystems_vs._packages"></a>The 
  Design Model can be structured into smaller units to make it easier to understand. 
  By grouping Design Model elements into packages and subsystems, then showing 
  how those groupings relate to one another, it is easier to understand the overall 
  structure of the model. Note that a <b><a href="../glossary.htm#design_subsystem">design 
  subsystem</a></b> is a special kind of package which has behavioral semantics 
  (i.e. it realizes one or more interfaces); for more information, see <a href="../artifact/ar_dsub.htm">Artifact: 
  Design Subsystem</a> and <a href="md_dsub.htm">Guidelines: Design Subsystem</a>. 
  Design packages, on the other hand, are just for grouping.</p>

Content Visibility</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A class contained in a package can be public or private. A <a name="XE_public_class__in_package"></a><b>public
class </b>can be associated by any other class. A <a name="XE_private_class__in_package"></a><b>private
class </b>can be associated only by classes contained in the package.</p>
<p>A package interface consists of a package's public classes. The package
interface (public classes) isolates and implements the dependencies on other
packages. In this way, parallel development is simplified because you can
establish interfaces early on, and the developers need to know only about
changes in the interfaces of other packages.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_design_package__package_partitioning_criteria"></a><a name="Package-Partitioning Criteria">Package-Partitioning
Criteria</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You can partition the Design Model for a number of reasons:
<ul>
  <li>You can use packages and subsystems as order, configuration, or delivery
    units when a system is finished.</li>
  <li>Allocation of resources and the competence of different development teams
    may require that the project be divided among different groups at different
    sites. Subsystems, with well-defined interfaces, provide a way to divide
    work between teams in a controlled, coordinated way, allowing design and
    implementation to proceed in parallel.</li>
  <li>Subsystems can be used to structure the design model in a way that
    reflects the user types. Many change requirements originate from users;
    subsystems ensure that changes from a particular user type will affect only
    the parts of the system that correspond to that user type.</li>
  <li>In some applications, certain information should be accessible to only a
    few people. Subsystems let you preserve secrecy in areas where it is needed.</li>
  <li>If you are building a support system, you can, using subsystems and
    packages to give it a structure similar to the structure of the system to be
    supported. In this way, you can synchronize the maintenance of the two
    systems.</li>
  <li><a name="XE_existing_product__representing_with_packages"></a>Subsystems
    are used to represent the existing products and services that the system
    uses (for example, COTS products, and libraries), as explained in the next
    several sections.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="XE_boundary_class__packaging"></a><a name="Packaging Boundary Classes">Packaging
Boundary Classes </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>When the boundary classes are distributed to packages there are two different
strategies that can be applied; which one to choose depends on whether or not
the system interfaces are likely to change greatly in the future.
<ul>
  <li>If it is likely that the system interface will be replaced, or undergo
    considerable changes, the interface should be separated from the rest of the
    design model. When the user interface is changed, only these packages are
    affected. An example of such a major change is the switch from a
    line-oriented interface to a window-oriented interface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp2.gif" width="234" height="148"></p>
<p class="picturetext">If the primary aim is to simplify major interface
changes, the boundary classes should be placed in one (or several) separate
packages.
<ul>
  <li>If no major interface changes are planned, changes to the system services
    should be the guiding principle, rather than changes to the interface. The
    boundary classes should then be placed together with the entity and control
    classes with which they are functionally related. This way, it will be easy
    to see what boundary classes are affected if a certain entity or control
    class is changed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp3.gif" width="257" height="71"></p>
<p class="picturetext">To simplify changes to the services of the system, the
boundary classes are packaged with the classes to which they are functionally
related.</p>
<p>Mandatory boundary classes that are not functionally related to any entity-
or control classes, should be placed in separate packages, together with
boundary classes that belong to the same interface.</p>
<p>If a boundary class is related to an optional service, group it with the
classes that collaborate to provide the service, in a separate subsystem. The
subsystem will map onto an optional component which will be provided when the
optional functionality is ordered.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_design_package__functionally_related_classes?_finding_packages_for"></a><a name="Packaging Functionally Related Classes">Packaging
Functionally Related Classes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A package should be identified for each group of classes that are
functionally related. There are several practical criteria that can be applied
when judging if two classes are functionally related. These are, in order of
diminishing importance:
<ul>
  <li>If changes in one class' behavior and/or structure necessitate changes in
    another class, the two classes are functionally related.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
  <p class="example">If a new attribute is added to the entity class <b>Order</b>,
  this will most likely necessitate updating the control class <b>Order
  Administrator</b>. Therefore, they belong to the same package, <b>Order
  Handling</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>It is possible to find out if one class is functionally related to another
    by beginning with a class - for example, an entity class - and examining the
    impact of it being removed from the system. Any classes that become
    superfluous as a result of a class removal are somehow connected to the
    removed class. By superfluous, we mean that the class is only used by the
    removed class, or is itself dependent upon the removed class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
  <p class="example">There is a package <b>Order Handling</b>
  containing the two control classes <b>Order Administrator </b>and <b>Order
  Registrar,</b> in the <b>Depot Handling System.</b> Both of
  these control classes model services regarding order handling in the depot.
  All order attributes and relationships are stored by the entity class <b>Order</b>,
  which only exists for order handling. If the entity class is removed, there
  will be no need for the <b>Order Administrator </b>or the <b>Order
  Registrar</b>, because they are only useful if the <b>Order</b>
  is there. Therefore, the entity class <b>Order</b> should be
  included in the same package as the two control classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp4.gif" width="393" height="163"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="picturetext" align="center">
  <b>Order Administrator </b>and <b>Order
  Registrar</b> belong to the same package as <b>Order</b>,
  because they become superfluous if <b>Order</b> is removed from the
  system.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Two objects can be functionally related if they interact with a large
    number of messages, or have an otherwise complicated intercommunication.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example"><b>Example</b></p>
  <p class="example">The control class <b>Task Performer </b>sends and
  receives many messages to and from the <b>Transporter Interface.</b>
  This is another indication that they should be included in the same package, <b>Task
  Handling.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>A boundary class can be functionally related to a particular entity class
    if the function of the boundary class is to present the entity class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example"><b>Example</b></p>
  <p class="example">The boundary class, <b>Pallet
  Form</b>, in the <b>Depot Handling System</b>, presents
  an instance of the entity class <b>Pallet</b> to the user. Each <b>Pallet
  </b>is represented by an identification number on the screen. If the
  information about a <b>Pallet</b> is changed, for example, if the <b>Pallet</b>
  is also given a name, the boundary class might have to be changed as well. <b>Pallet
  Form</b> should therefore be included in the same package as <b>Pallet</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Two classes can be functionally related if they interact with, or are
    affected by changes in, the same actor. If two classes do not involve the
    same actor, they should not lie in the same package. The last rule can, of
    course, be ignored for more important reasons.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example"><b>Example</b></p>
  <p class="example">There is a package <b>Task Handling </b>in the <b>Depot
  Handling System</b>, which includes, among other things, the control
  class <b>Task Performer</b>. This is the only package involved with
  the actor <b>Transporter</b>, the physical transporter that can
  transport a pallet in the depot. The actor interacts with the control class <b>Task
  Performer </b>via the boundary class <b>Transporter Interface.</b>
  This boundary class should therefore be included in the package <b>Task
  Handling</b>.</p>
  <p class="example" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp5.gif" alt width="470" height="163"></p>
  <p class="picturetext"><b>Transporter Interface</b> and <b>Task
  Performer</b> belong to the same package since both of them are affected
  by changes in the <b>Transporter</b> actor.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Two classes can be functionally related if they have relationships between
    each other (associations, aggregations, and so on). Of course, this
    criterion cannot be followed mindlessly, but can be used when no other
    criterion is applicable.</li>
  <li>A class can be functionally related to the class that creates instances of
    it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two criteria determine when two classes should <b>not</b> be
placed in the same package:
<ul>
  <li>Two classes that are related to different actors should not be placed in
    the same package.</li>
  <li>An optional and a mandatory class should not be placed in the same
    package.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Evaluating Package Cohesion">Evaluating Package Cohesion </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>First, all elements in a package must have the same optionality: there can be
no optional model elements in a mandatory package.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">The mandatory entity class <b>Article Type</b> has,
among other things, an attribute called <b>Restock Threshold</b>. The
restock function, however, is optional in the system. Therefore, <b>Article</b>
should be split up into two entity classes, where the optional class relates the
mandatory one.</p>
<p>A package that is considered mandatory might not depend on any package that
is considered optional.</p>
<p>As a rule, a single package can not be used by two different actors. The
reason for this is that a change in one actor's behavior should not affect other
actors as well. There are exceptions to this rule, such as for packages that
constitute optional services. Packages of this type should not be divided, no
matter how many actors use it. Therefore, split any package, or class, that is
used by several actors unless the package is optional.</p>
<p>All classes in the same package must be functionally related. If you have
followed the criteria in the section &quot;Find packages from Functionally
Related Classes,&quot; the classes in one package will be functionally related
among themselves. However, a particular class might in itself contain &quot;too
much&quot; behavior, or relationships that do not belong to the class. Part of
the class should then be removed to become a completely new class, or to some
other class, which probably will belong to another package.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">The behavior of a control class, <b>A</b>, in one
package should not depend too much on a class, <b>B</b>, in another
package. To isolate the <b>B</b>-specific behavior, the control class <b>A</b>
must be split into two control classes, <b>A' </b>and <b>A&quot;</b>.
The <b>B</b>-specific behavior is placed in the new control class, <b>A&quot;</b>,
which is placed in the same package as <b>B</b>. The new class <b>A&quot;</b>
also gets a relationship, such as generalization, to the original object <b>A'</b>.</p>
<p class="example" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp6.gif" width="316" height="206"></p>
<p class="picturetext">To isolate the <b>B</b>-specific behavior, the
control class <b>A</b>, which lacks homogeneity, is split into two
control classes, <b>A'</b> and <b>A''</b>.</p>
<h3><a name="Describing Packages Dependendencies">Describing Package </a>Dependencies
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>If a class in one package has an association to a class in a different
package, then these packages depend on each other. Package dependencies are
modeled using a dependency relationship between the packages. Dependency
relationships help us to assess the consequence of changes: a package upon which
many packages depend is more difficult to change than one upon which no packages
depend.</p>
<p>Because several dependencies like this will be discovered during the
specification of the packages, these relationships are bound to change during
the work. The description of a dependency relationship might include information
about what class relationships have caused the dependency. Since this introduces
information that is difficult to maintain, it should be done only if the
information is pertinent and of value.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the <b>Depot Handling System</b> there is a
dependency relationship from the package <b>Order Handling </b>to the
package <b>Item Handling.</b> This association arises because the
entity class <b>Order </b>in <b>Order Handling</b> has an
association to the entity class <b>Item Type </b>in the other package.</p>
<p class="example" align="center"><img src="images/md_desp7.gif" width="264" height="256"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The package <b>Order Handling</b> is dependent
on <b>Item Handling</b>, because there is an association between two
classes in the packages.</p>
<h3><a name="Evaluating Package Coupling">Evaluating Package Coupling</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Package coupling is good and bad: good, because coupling represent re-use,
and bad, because coupling represents dependencies that make the system harder to
change and evolve. Some general principles can be followed:
<ul>
  <li>Packages should not be cross-coupled (i.e. co-dependent); e.g. two
    packages should not be dependent on one another.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/md_dpkg1.gif" width="300" height="109"></p>
  <p class="picturetext">In these cases, the packages need to be reorganized to
  remove the cross-dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Packages in lower layers should not be dependent upon packages in upper
    layers. Packages should only be dependent upon packages in the same layer
    and in the next lower layer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/md_dpkg2.gif" width="200" height="239"></p>
  <p class="picturetext">In these cases, the functionality needs to be
  repartitioned. One solution is to state the dependencies in terms of
  interfaces, and organize the interfaces in the lower layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>In general, dependencies should not skip layers, unless the dependent
    behavior is common across all layers, and the alternative is to simply
    pass-through operation invocations across layers.</li>
  <li>Packages should not depend on subsystems, only on other packages or on
    interfaces.</li>
</ul>
