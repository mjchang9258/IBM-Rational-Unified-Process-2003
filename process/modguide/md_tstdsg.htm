<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Nothing has a greater effect on the end-user's satisfaction with the software
than a clear view of what the end-user expects so that those expectations can be
verified and validated. Test cases reflect the requirements that are to be
verified. Verifying these requirements, however, may be done differently and by
different testers. For example, executing the software to verify its function
and performance may be done by a tester using automated test techniques, the
shut-down sequence of a computer system may be done by manual test and
observation, while market share and sales, (also product requirements), will be
done by measuring product and competitive sales.</p>
<p>Since you may not be able to (or be responsible to) verify all requirements,
it is critical for the success of your project to select the most appropriate or
critical ones requirements for test. The requirements you choose to verify will
be a balance between the cost, risk, and necessity of having the requirement
verified.</p>
<p>Identifying the test cases is important for several reasons.
<ul>
  <li>Test cases form the foundation on which to design and develop Test Scripts.</li>
  <li>The &quot;depth&quot; of the testing is proportional to the number of test
    cases. Greater confidence in the quality of the product and test process is
    gained when the number of test cases increases, since each test case
    reflects a different scenario, condition, or flow through the product.</li>
  <li>A principal measure of the completeness of test is requirements-based
    coverage, based on the of the number test cases identified, implemented, and
    / or executed. A statement such as &quot;95 percent of our critical test
    cases have been executed and verified&quot; is more significant than stating
    &quot;We're 95 percent of the way through our tests.&quot;</li>
  <li>The scale of the test effort is proportional to the number of test cases.
    With a comprehensive breakdown of test cases, the timing of succeeding
    stages of the test cycle can be more accurately estimated.</li>
  <li>The kinds of test design and development, and the resources needed are
    largely governed by the test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test cases are often categorized or classified by the type of test or
requirement for test they are associated with, and will vary accordingly. Best
practice is to develop at least two test cases for each requirement for test:
<ul>
  <li>a test case to demonstrate the requirement has been achieved, often
    referred to as a positive test case,</li>
  <li>another test case, reflecting an unacceptable, abnormal, or unexpected
    condition or data, to demonstrate that the requirement is only achieved
    under the desired condition, referred to as a negative test cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="DerivingTestCasesforUnitTest">Deriving Test Cases for Unit Test 
  </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unit testing requires testing both the unit's internal structure and its behavioral 
  characteristics. Testing the internal structure requires a&nbsp; knowledge of 
  how the unit is implemented, and tests based upon this knowledge are known as 
  white-box tests. Testing a unit's behavioral characteristics focuses on the 
  external observable behaviors of the unit without knowledge or regard its implementation. 
  Tests based upon this approach are referred to as black-box tests. Deriving 
  test cases based upon both approaches are described below.</p>

<h4><a name="WhiteBox_tests"></a><a name="XE_white-box_test__of_units">White-Box 
  Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Theoretically, you should test every possible path through the code. Achieving 
  such a goal, in all but very simple units, is either impractical or almost impossible. 
  At the very least you should exercise every <b>decision-to-decision path</b> 
  (DD-path) at least once, resulting in executing all statements at least once. 
  A decision is typically an if-statement, and a DD-path is a path between two 
  decisions.</p>
<p>To get this level of test coverage, it is recommended that you choose test 
  data so that every decision is evaluated in every possible way. Toward that 
  end, the test cases should make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every Boolean expression is evaluated to <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>. For 
    example the expression (a&lt;3) OR (b&gt;4) evaluates to four combinations 
    of <b>true</b>/<b>false</b></li>
  <li>Every infinite loop is exercised at least zero times, once, and more than 
    once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use code-coverage tools to identify the code not exercised by your white box 
  testing. Reliability testing should be done simultaneously with your white-box 
  testing.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">Assume that you perform a structure test on a function <b>member</b> 
  in the class <b>Set of Integers. </b>The test - with the help of a binary search 
  - checks whether the set contains a given integer.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="../activity/images/untst001.gif" width="301" height="200"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The member function and its corresponding flowchart. Dotted 
  arrows illustrate how you can use two test cases to execute all the statements 
  at least once.</p>
<p>Theoretically, for an operation to be thoroughly tested, the test case should 
  traverse all the combinations of routes in the code. In <b>member</b>, there 
  are three alternative routes inside the <b>while-loop</b>. The test case can 
  traverse the loop either several times or not at all. If the test case does 
  not traverse the loop at all, you will find only one route through the code. 
  If it traverses the loop once, you will find three routes. If it traverses twice, 
  you will find six routes, and so forth. Thus, the total number of routes will 
  be 1+3+6+12+24+48+…, which in practice, is an unmanageable number of route combinations. 
  That is why you must choose a subset of all these routes. In this example, you 
  can use two test cases to execute all the statements. In one test case, you 
  might choose <code><b>Set of Integers</b> = {1,5,7,8,11}</code> and <code><b>t</b> = 3</code> as test 
  data. In the other test case, you might choose <code><b>Set of Integers</b> = {1,5,7,8,11}</code> 
  and <code><b>t</b> = 8</code>.</p>

<h4><a name="BlackBox_Tests"></a>Black-Box 
  Tests<a name="XE_black-box_test__of_units"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The purpose of a black-box test is to verify the unit's specified behavior 
  without looking at <b>how </b>the unit implements that behavior. Black-box tests 
  focus and rely upon the unit's input and output.</p>
<p><b>Equivalence partitioning</b><b> </b>is a technique for reducing the required 
  number of tests.<b> </b>For every operation, you should identify the equivalence 
  classes of the arguments and the object states. An <b>equivalence class</b> 
  is a set of values for which an object is supposed to behave similarly. For 
  example, a <b>Set</b> has three equivalence classes: <b>empty</b>, <b>some element, 
  </b>and<b> full</b>.</p>
<p>Use code-coverage tools to identify the code not exercised by your white box 
  testing. Reliability testing should be done simultaneously with your black-box 
  testing.</p>
<p>The next two subsections describe how to identify test cases by selecting test 
  data for specific arguments.</p>

<h5>Test Cases based upon Input Arguments</h5>
<p>An <b>input argument </b>is an argument used by an operation. You should create 
  test cases by using input arguments for each operation, for each of the following 
  input conditions:&nbsp; 
<ul>
  <li>Normal values from each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values on the boundary of each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values outside the equivalence classes.</li>
  <li>Illegal values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to treat the object state as an input argument. If, for example, you 
  test an operation <b>add </b>on an object <b>Set</b>, you must test <b>add </b>with 
  values from all of <b>Set</b>'s equivalence classes, that is, with a full <b>Set</b>, 
  with some element in <b>Set, </b>and with an empty<b> Set</b>.</p>

<h5>Test Cases based upon Output Arguments</h5>
<p>An <b>output argument</b> is an argument that an operation changes. An argument 
  can be both an input and an output argument. Select input so that you get <b>output</b> 
  according to each of the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal values from each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values on the boundary for each equivalence class.</li>
  <li>Values outside the equivalence classes.</li>
  <li>Illegal values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to treat the object state as an output argument. If for example, you 
  test an operation <b>remove</b> on a <b>List</b>, you must choose input values 
  so that <b>List</b> is full, has some element, and is empty after the operation 
  is performed (test with values from all its equivalence classes).</p>
<p>If the object is state-controlled (reacts differently depending on the object's 
  state), you should use a state matrix such as the one in the following figure.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="../activity/images/untst002.gif" width="184" height="166"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A state matrix for testing. You can test all combinations 
  of state and stimuli on the basis of this matrix.</p>
