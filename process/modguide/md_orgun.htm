<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Business systems represent an independent capability within a business. They 
  are used to partition and understand the structure of a business into manageable 
  chunks, in much the same way that an organization is typically partitioned into 
  interdependent units. However, the role and purpose of different parts of an 
  organization are not always clear to other parts of it, which results in less-than-optimal 
  interactions when executing a business process. </p>

<p>Business systems take the concept of partitioning and interdependence one step 
  further. Business systems not only bind and contain roles and resources (and 
  possible other business systems), but they also explicitly define <i>interfaces</i>, 
  or the set of services or responsibilities they can be asked to provide. Organizations 
  that define <i>service level agreements</i> to formally specify and manage interactions 
  between departments and external collaborators are in effect defining business 
  systems. The use of a business system often goes hand-in-hand with using business 
  models at different levels of abstraction (see <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_large.htm">Concepts: 
  Modeling Large Organizations</a>). </p>
<p>The term &quot;business system&quot; should not be confused with a software 
  system. A business system contains people, hardware, and software and is therefore 
  at a higher level of abstraction than a software system. </p>

<h3><a name="Business Systems Enable Dynamic Structure"></a>Business
Systems Enable Dynamic Structure<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>In his book <i>Enterprise Modeling with UML</i>, Chris Marshall points out 
  that traditional relatively static organizational structures are no longer sufficient 
  for the radically decentralized and dynamic business world that is emerging. 
  We can no longer expect a part of the organization to remain intact for long 
  periods of time. As he states in his book, &quot;Value is created and delivered 
  through value chains that form and disband over time. Indeed, the day when such 
  a chain is formed for a single transaction may not be far away.&quot; </p>
<p>Organizations are organic. As they feel increasing pressure from the business 
  environment, they need to adapt to remain competitive. Taken to the extreme, 
  a static organization structure may be crippling in a highly dynamic and ruthless 
  business environment, and companies may need to turn to <b>dynamic structure 
  </b> as a survival mechanism. </p>

<p>In the traditional static organization structure, departmental boundaries are 
  only conceptual. While this may be a sign of an &quot;open&quot; and &quot;informal&quot; 
  organization, the result is that every person in and segment of the organization 
  is intertwined with the rest of the organization. It becomes extremely difficult 
  to change or manage one part of the organization completely independently from 
  the other parts. Business systems enforce partitions and boundaries by disallowing 
  interactions between business systems, except by the predefined interfaces. 
  These interfaces (possibly formalized service-level agreements) become the hinges 
  that support the organization. The most significant advantage to these interfaces 
  between business systems is that different parts of the organization are decoupled 
  from each other. Dependencies are defined in terms of responsibilities and not 
  on <i>how</i> those responsibilities are carried out. </p>

<p>Separating the specification of responsibilities from the realization of responsibilities 
  results in a nimble organization—one that is capable of changing its structure 
  rapidly without degrading the performance of its processes. In such an organization, 
  one of its capabilities (defined by a business system) can be modified, improved, 
  or outsourced, and the overall effect on the rest of the organization is kept 
  to a minimum. As long as the quality of service remains the same after the change, 
  the business operations continue uninterrupted. The same work could be performed 
  by a software system, one person, or an entire department—either on-site or 
  remote. </p>

space transparent, business systems can interact indirectly (see <a href="md_bevnt.htm">Guidelines: Business Event</a>).

<h3><a name="Business Systems Have Well-defined Responsibilities"></a>Business 
  Systems Have Well-Defined Responsibilities<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Business systems explicitly define the responsibilities (also called services) 
  that they can be asked to perform. This specification of behavior is essential 
  because it allows the decoupling of dependencies mentioned in the previous section. 
  A business system that does not define its services is without meaning. There 
  is no way that another business system can know what services it provides, other 
  than inferring them from its name. For example, we could expect a Resourcing 
  business system (in departmental terms, it would be called Resource Management) 
  to provide services for requesting a resource, querying the availability of 
  resources, and possibly querying the resources types, or profiles. </p>

<p>Responsibilities (or services) define the means of interaction with the business 
  system and are specified as operations of the interface(s) to it. These interfaces 
  are collections of related services and as such describe the role that the business 
  system can play in a particular interaction. In the example that appears below 
  the next paragraph, we see that each interface is a collection of logically 
  related services. These interfaces (clusters of responsibility) are assigned 
  to the business system responsible for carrying out the responsibilities. When 
  something external to the business system requests one of the provided services, 
  an event occurs within the business system to initiate fulfillment of the requested 
  service. This event, which is internal to the business system, may be explicitly 
  defined as a business event. The roles and resources (business workers and business 
  entities) within the business system then collaborate with each other (internally) 
  to fulfill the requested service. As we can see, this is much the same way the 
  business operates toward its customers. In fact, we could even model the business 
  system as a &quot;business,&quot; in which case the requestors of services would 
  be the business system's business actors. </p>

<p>The example below shows the business systems of a generic financial services 
  institution. Only some of the dependencies between business systems and interfaces 
  are shown to improve understandability. From this diagram, it becomes apparent 
  that the responsibilities can be reassigned by allocating an interface to another 
  business system. This reallocation of responsibility would conceptually have 
  no effect on the business systems that make use of those services. </p>

<h3><a name="Business Systems Contain Roles and Resources"></a>Business Systems
Contain Roles and Resources<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>A business system is an abstraction of a collection of people, hardware, and 
  software that work together to perform the responsibilities of the business 
  system. We use the word &quot;abstraction&quot; because we do not describe the 
  internal collaborations within the business system in terms of people, machines, 
  and software, but in terms of roles and resources. A business system contains 
  business workers and business entities. A business worker is a role that represents 
  <i>either</i> a human or a hardware or software system. A business entity is 
  a piece of information created or manipulated by business workers. These business 
  workers can eventually be mapped to human resources, or to specific hardware 
  or software systems. This abstraction helps us focus on the role of the business 
  worker and determine the <i>necessary </i>responsibilities without having to 
  consider the (usually imperfect) real situation of a specific person or system. 
</p>

<h3><a name="Business Use Cases Cut Across Business Systems"></a>Business Use
Cases Cut Across Business Systems <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Business use cases must not be allocated to a business system. Business use 
  cases are the customer-facing processes that require the collaboration of a 
  number of business systems, partners, and suppliers. This is referred to as 
  the <i>value chain</i>. Business systems collaborate to perform business use 
  cases, as shown in the figure below. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bsys1.gif" width="602" height="325"> 
</p>

There is one exception: When creating business models at different levels of abstraction 
(see <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_large.htm">Concepts: Modeling Large Organizations</a>), 
business use cases can be allocated to a business system. For example, you may 
want to model the business as a whole as well as one of the business systems of 
that business. In this case, there would be a Business Use-Case Model for the 
entire business, in which the overall business use cases would cut across the 
business systems (as shown above). At a lower level, the services requested from 
a particular business system could be captured as business use cases in the business 
system's Business Use-Case Model. The guideline that states that business use 
cases should not be allocated to a business system should then actually read: 
&quot;A business use case at a particular level should not be allocated in its 
entirety to only one business system at a lower level.&quot; 
<p> This cross-functional nature of business use cases is one of the reasons for 
  the interest in business modeling and re-engineering, as well as in analysis 
  of the cost and performance of business processes (see <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_abc.htm">Concept: 
  Activity-Based Costing</a>). It is more valuable to understand how the cost 
  of the entire business use case relates to the added value provided to the customer 
  than to know how the annual budget of one of the departments relates to the 
  overall corporate budget. </p>

<h3><a name="Examples"></a>Examples <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<h4>Furniture Store 
</h4>

<p>The figure below shows the business systems for the furniture store used as 
  an example in <a href="md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: Business Goal</a> and <a href="md_bucm.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Use-Case Model</a>. This store keeps large inventory in a warehouse 
  attached to its showroom. This allows customers to browse through the products 
  on display in the showroom and pick up the products they have purchased at the 
  warehouse. Customers can arrange for delivery of large items. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bsys2.gif">

</p>

<p align="left">This business has been divided into three interdependent
business systems. Each business system has a clear purpose and provides
well-defined services (not visible in the diagram). Explicitly defining these
interdependencies and interactions helps to optimize the business.

</p>

<h4>Airport 
</h4>

<p>An airport provides services to airlines and to passengers and visitors on 
  behalf of the airlines. Because an airport is a very large and complex business 
  to model, it makes sense to divide it into a number of independent business 
  systems. Each business system can then be modeled independently as a business 
  in its own right, as shown below. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bsys3.gif">

</p>

<p align="left">In the example above, we see that an airline would have to participate 
  in the Passengers and Flights business systems. Air traffic would be regulated 
  by Air Traffic Control, according to laws and regulations. Hangar Facilities 
  would provide services to the ground crews of the airline. Both Passengers and 
  Flights would use services provided by Baggage Handling for departures and arrivals, 
  respectively. The entertainment business system could also be called Airport 
  Facilities and would include such things as shops, waiting areas, parking, and 
  transport. </p>
