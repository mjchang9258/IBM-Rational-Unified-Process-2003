<p>The references section presents external documents which provide background
information important to an understanding of the architecture of the system. If
there are a larger number of references, structure the section in subsections:
<ol>
  <li>external documents</li>
  <li>internal documents</li>
  <li>government documents</li>
  <li>non-government documents</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Architectural Goals and Constraints">Architectural Goals and
Constraints</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The architecture will be formed by considering:</p>
<ul>
  <li>functional requirements, captured in the Use-Case Model, and</li>
  <li>non-functional requirements, captured in the Supplementary Specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these are not the only influences that will shape the architecture: 
  there will be constraints imposed by the environment in which the software must 
  operate; by the need to reuse existing assets; by the imposition of various 
  standards; by the need for compatibility with existing systems, and so on.&nbsp; 
  There may also be a preexisting set of <b>architectural principles and policies</b> 
  which will guide the development, and which need to be elaborated and reified 
  for the project.&nbsp; This section of the Software Architecture document is 
  the place to describe these goals and constraints, and any <b>architectural 
  decisions</b> flowing from them which do not find a ready home (as requirements) 
  elsewhere.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When this document is created, an important input is a specification of the
implementation environment. Examples of things that should be specified are
target platform (hardware, operating system), window system, development tools (language, GUI builder), database management system, and
component libraries.&nbsp; It is also valuable to specify which user interface technologies are allowed and
  which are not.&nbsp; Many
  systems choose to not use certain presentation technologies (JavaScript, Applets, Frames,
XML, etc.) so that more client systems are capable of using the application,
  or to make the application easier to develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisions are
captured here in the Software Architecture Document, while the details for how
to use and apply the chosen technologies is documented in the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">artifact:
Project Specific Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>The enforcement of these decisions is achieved by framing a set of <b>architecture 
  evaluation criteria </b>which will be used as part of the iteration assessment.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria are also derived from <b>Change Cases </b>which document
likely future changes to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the system's capabilities and properties</li>
  <li>the way the system is used</li>
  <li>the system's operating and support environments</li>
</ul>
<p>Change Cases clarify those properties of the system described by subjective
phrases such as, &quot;easy to extend&quot;, &quot;easy to port&quot;,
&quot;easy to maintain&quot;, &quot;robust in the face of change&quot;, and
&quot;quick to develop&quot;. Change Cases focus on what is important and likely
rather than just what is possible.</p>
<p>Change Cases try to predict changes: such predictions rarely turn out to be
exactly true.</p>
<p>The properties of a system are determined by users, sponsors, suppliers,
developers, and other stakeholders. Changes can arise from many sources, for
example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business drivers: new and modified business processes and goals</li>
  <li>Technology drivers: adaptation of the system to new platforms, integration
    with new components</li>
  <li>Changes in the profiles of the average user</li>
  <li>Changes in the integration needs with other systems</li>
  <li>Scope changes arising from the migration of functionality from external
    systems</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="The Use-Case View">The Use-Case View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Use-Case View presents a subset of the <a href="../artifact/ar_ucmod.htm">Artifact:
Use-Case Model</a>, presenting the architecturally significant use-cases of the
system. It describes the set of scenarios and/or use cases that represent some
significant, central functionality. It also describes the set of scenarios
and/or use cases that have a substantial architectural coverage (that exercise
many architectural elements) or that stress or illustrate a specific, delicate
point of the architecture.</p>
<p>If the model is larger, it will typically be organized in packages; for ease
of understanding the use-case view should similarly organized by package, if
they are packaged. For each significant use case, include a subsection with the
following information:
<ol>
  <li>The name of the use case.</li>
  <li>A brief description of the use case.</li>
  <li>Significant descriptions of the <b>Flow of Events </b>of the use
    case. This can be the whole <b>Flow of Events </b>description, or
    subsections of it that describe significant flows or scenarios of the use
    case.</li>
  <li>Significant descriptions of relationships involving the use case, such as
    include- and extend-relationships, or communicates-associations.</li>
  <li>An enumeration of the significant use-case diagrams related to the use
    case.</li>
  <li>Significant descriptions of <b>Special Requirements </b>of the
    use case. This can be the whole <b>Special Requirements</b>
    description, or subsections of it that describe significant requirements.</li>
  <li>Significant <b>Pictures of the User Interface, </b>clarifying
    the use case.</li>
  <li>The realizations of these use cases should be found in the logical view.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The <a name="Contents">Logical View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Logical View is a subset of the <a href="../artifact/ar_desmd.htm">Artifact:
Design Model</a> which presents architecturally significant design elements. It
describes the most important classes, their organization in packages and
subsystems, and the organization of these packages and subsystems into layers.
It also describes the most important use-case realizations, for example, the
dynamic aspects of the architecture.</p>
<p>A complex system may require a number of sections to describe the Logical
View:
<ol>
  <li><b>Overview</b>
    <p>This subsection describes the overall decomposition of the design model
    in terms of its package hierarchy and layers. If the system has several
    levels of packages, you should first describe those that are significant at
    the top level. Include any diagrams showing significant top-level packages,
    as well as their interdependencies and layering. Next present any
    significant packages within these, and so on all the way down to the
    significant packages at the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Architecturally Significant Design Packages</b>
    <p>For each significant package, include a subsection with the following
    information
    <ol>
      <li>Its name.</li>
      <li>A brief description.</li>
      <li>A diagram with all significant classes and packages contained within
        the package. For a better understanding this diagram may show some
        classes from other packages if necessary.</li>
      <li>For each significant class in the package, include its name, brief
        description, and, optionally a description of some of its major
        responsibilities, operations and attributes. Also describe its important
        relationships if necessary to understand the included diagrams.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Use-Case Realizations</b>
    <p>This section illustrates how the software works by giving a few selected
    use-case (or scenario) realizations, and explains how the various design
    model elements contribute to their functionality. The realizations given
    here are chosen because they represent some significant, central
    functionality of the final system; or for their architectural coverage -
    they exercise many architectural elements - or stress or illustrate a
    specific, delicate point of the architecture. The corresponding use cases
    and scenarios of these realizations should be found in the use-case view.</p>
    <p>For each significant use-case realization, include a subsection with the
    following information
    <ol>
      <li>The name of the realized use case.</li>
      <li>A brief description of the realized use case.</li>
      <li>Significant descriptions of the <b>Flow of Events - Design </b>of
        the use-case realization. This can be the whole <b>Flow of Events -
        Design </b>description, or subsections of it that describe the
        realization of significant flows or scenarios of the use case.</li>
      <li>An enumeration of the significant interaction or class diagrams
        related to the use-case realization.</li>
      <li>Significant descriptions of <b>Derived Requirements </b>of
        the use-case realization. This can be the whole <b>Derived
        Requirements</b> description, or subsections of it that describe
        significant requirements.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Architecturally Significant Design Elements</h4>
<p>To assist in deciding what is architecturally significant, some examples of
qualifying elements and their characteristics are presented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A model element that encapsulates a major abstraction of the problem
    domain, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>A flight plan in an air-traffic control system.</li>
      <li>An employee in a payroll system.</li>
      <li>A subscriber in a telephone system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p>Sub-types of these should not necessarily be included, e.g. Distinguishing
  an <b>ICAO Standard Flight Plan </b>from a <b>US Domestic
  Flight Plan </b>is not important; they are all flight plans and share a
  substantial amount of attributes and operations.</p>
  <p>Distinguishing a subscriber with a data line, or with a voice line, does
  not matter as long as the call handling proceeds in roughly the same way.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A model element that is used by many other model elements.</li>
  <li>A model element that encapsulates a major mechanism (service) of the
    system</li>
  <li>Design Mechanisms
    <ul>
      <li>Persistency mechanism (repository, database, memory management).</li>
      <li>Communication mechanism (RPC, broadcast, broker service).</li>
      <li>Error handling or recovery mechanism.</li>
      <li>Display mechanism, and other common interfaces (windowing, data
        capture, signal conditioning, and so on).</li>
      <li>Parameterization mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In general, any mechanism likely to be used in many different packages (as
opposed to completely internal to a package), and for which it is wise to have
one single common implementation throughout the system, or at least a single
interface that hides several alternative implementations.
<ul>
  <li>A model element that participates in a major interface in the system with,
    for example:
    <ul>
      <li>An operating system.</li>
      <li>An off-the-shelf product (windowing system, RDBMS, geographic
        information system).</li>
      <li>A class that implements or supports an architectural pattern (such as
        patterns for de-coupling model elements, including the
        model-view-controller pattern, or the broker pattern).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A model element that is of localized visibility, but may have some huge
    impact on the overall performance of the system, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>A polling mechanism to scan sensors at a very high rate.</li>
      <li>A tracing mechanism for troubleshooting.</li>
      <li>A check-pointing mechanism for high-availability system (check-point
        and restart).</li>
      <li>A start-up sequence.</li>
      <li>An online update of code.</li>
      <li>A class that encapsulates a novel and technically risky algorithm, or
        some algorithm that is safety-critical or security-critical, for
        example: computation of irradiation level; airplane collision-avoidance
        criteria for congested airspace; Password encryption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The criteria as to what is architecturally significant will evolve in the
early iterations of the project, as you discover technical difficulties and
begin to better understand the system. As a rule however, you should label at
most 10% of the model elements as &quot;<b>architecturally significant</b>.&quot;
Otherwise you risk diluting the concept of architecture, and &quot;everything is
architecture.&quot;</p>
<p>When you define and include the architecturally significant model elements in
the logical view, you should also take the following aspects into consideration
<ul>
  <li>Identify potential for commonality and reuse. Which classes could be
    subclasses of a common class, or instances of the same parameterized class?</li>
  <li>Identify potential for parameterization. What part of the design can be
    made more reusable or flexible by using static and run-time parameters (such
    as table-driven behavior, or resource data loaded at start-up time)?</li>
  <li>Identify potential for using off-the-shelf products.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="The Process View">The Process View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The process view describes the process structure of the system. Since the
process structure has great architectural impact, all processes should be
presented. Within processes, only architecturally significant lightweight
threads need be presented. The process view describes the tasks (processes and
threads) involved in the system's execution, their interactions and
configurations, as well as the allocation of objects and classes to tasks.</p>
<p>For each network of processes, include a subsection with the following
information:
<ol>
  <li>Its name.</li>
  <li>The processes involved.</li>
  <li>The interactions between processes in the form of collaboration diagrams,
    in which the objects are actual processes that encompass their own threads
    of control. For each process, briefly describe its behavior, lifetime and
    communication characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="The Deployment View">The Deployment View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section describes one or more physical network (hardware) configurations
on which the software is deployed and run. It also describes the allocation of
tasks (from the <b>Process View</b>) to the physical nodes. For each
physical network configuration, include a subsection with the following
information:
<ol>
  <li>Its name.</li>
  <li>A deployment diagram illustrating the configuration, followed by a mapping
    of processes to each processor.</li>
  <li>If there are many possible physical configurations, just describe a
    typical one and then explain the general mapping rules to follow in defining
    others. You should also include, in most cases, descriptions of network
    configurations for performing software tests and simulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This view is generated from the <a href="../artifact/ar_dplmdl.htm">Artifact:
Deployment Model</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="The Implementation View">The Implementation View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section describes the decomposition of the software into layers and implementation 
  subsystems in the implementation model. It also provides an overview of the 
  allocation of design elements (from the Logical View) to the implementation. 
  It contains two subsections: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Overview</b> 
    <p>This subsection names and defines the various layers and their contents, 
      the rules that govern the inclusion to a given layer, and the boundaries 
      between layers. Include a component diagram that shows the relations between 
      layers.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Layers</b> 
    <p>For each layer, include a subsection with the following information: 
    <ol>
      <li>Its name.</li>
      <li>A component diagram showing the implementation subsystems and their 
        import dependencies.</li>
      <li>If appropriate, an outline of the layer's relationship to elements in 
        the logical or process view.</li>
      <li>An enumeration of the implementation subsystems located in the layer. 
        For each implementation subsystem: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Give its name, abbreviation or nickname, a brief description, and 
          a rationale for its existence;</li>
        <li>If appropriate, indicate the implementation subsystem's relationship 
          to elements in the logical or process view. In many cases, an implementation 
          subsystem will implement one or more design subsystems from the logical 
          view.</li>
        <li>If an implementation subsystem contains architecturally significant 
          implementation subsystems and/or <br>
          directories, consider reflecting this in the subsection hierarchy.<br>
        </li>
        <li> If an implementation subsystem doesn't map one-to-one with an implementation 
          directory, then include an explanation of how the implementation subsystem 
          is defined in terms of implementation directories and/or files.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>



<h3><a name="The Data View">The Data View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This view describes the architecturally significant persistent elements in
the data model. It describes an overview of the data model and its organization
in terms of the tables, views, indexes, triggers and stored procedures used to
provide persistence to the system. It also describes the mapping of persistent
classes (from the Logical View) to the data structure of the database</p>
<p>It typically includes:
<ul>
  <li>The mapping from key persistent design classes, especially where the
    mapping is non-trivial.</li>
  <li>The architecturally significant parts of the system which have been
    implemented in the database, in the form of stored procedures and triggers.</li>
  <li>Important decisions in other views which have data implications, such as
    choice of transaction strategy, distribution, concurrency, fault tolerance.
    For example, the choice to use database-based transaction management
    (relying on the database to commit or abort transactions) requires that the
    error handling mechanism used in the architecture include a strategy for
    recovering from a failed transaction by refreshing the state of persistence
    objects cached in memory in the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should present architecturally significant data model elements, describe
their responsibilities, as well as a few very important relationships and
behaviors (triggers, stored procedures, etc.).</p>

<h3><a name="Size and Performance">Size and Performance</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section describes architecturally-defining volumetric and responsiveness
characteristics of the system. The information presented may include:
<ul>
  <li>The number of key elements the system will have to handle (such as the
    number of concurrent flights for an air traffic control system, the number
    of concurrent phone calls for a telecom switch, the number of concurrent
    online users for an airline reservation system, etc.).</li>
  <li>The key performance measures of the system, such as average response time
    for key events; average, maximum and minimum throughput rates, etc.</li>
  <li>The footprint (in terms of disk and memory) of the executables - essential
    if the system is an embedded system which must live within extremely
    confining constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these qualities are captured as requirements; they are presented here
because they shape the architecture in significant ways and warrant special
focus. For each requirement, discuss how the architecture supports this
requirement.</p>
<h3><a name="Quality">Quality</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In this section, list the key quality dimensions of the system that shape the
architecture. The information presented may include:
<ul>
  <li>Operating performance requirements, such as <b>mean-time between
    failure </b>(MTBF).</li>
  <li>Quality targets, such as &quot;no unscheduled down-time&quot;</li>
  <li>Extensibility targets, such as &quot;the software will be upgradeable
    while the system is running&quot;.</li>
  <li>Portability targets, such as hardware platforms, operating systems,
    languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each dimension, discuss how the architecture supports this requirement. 
  You can organize the section by the different views (logical, implementation, 
  and so on), or by quality. When particular characteristics are important in 
  the system, for example, safety, security or privacy, the architectural support 
  for these should be carefully delineated in this section.</p>
