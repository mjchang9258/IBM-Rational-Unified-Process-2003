<p>The purpose of the test plan is to communicate the intent of the testing
activities. It is critical that this document be created as early as possible.
Generating this artifact early in one of the first iterations of the Elaboration
phase would not be too early. It may be desirable to develop the test plan
iteratively, adding sections as the information is available.</p>
<p>Care should be taken in clearly communicating the scope of testing, the
requirements for test, the test strategies, and the resource needs. This
information identifies the purpose and boundaries of the test effort, what will
be tested, how it will be tested, and what resources are needed for testing.
Stating this information clearly, will expedite the review, feedback, and
approval of the test effort.</p>
<p>At the outset of the project, a test plan identifying the overall intended
testing for the project should be created, called the &quot;Master Test
Plan.&quot; As each iteration is planned, a more precise &quot;Iteration Test
Plan&quot; is created (or several test plans, organized by type of test),
containing only the data (requirements for test, test strategies, resources,
etc.) that pertain to the iteration. Alternately, this information may be
included in the <a href="../artifact/ar_itpln.htm">Iteration Plan</a>, if it
does not make the iteration plan too difficult to manage or use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some guidelines to better identify and communicate the requirements
for test, test risks and priorities, and test strategies.</p>

<p>Requirements for test identify what will be tested. They are the specific
target of a test. There are a few general rules to apply when deriving
requirements for test:
<ul>
  <li>The requirement for test must be an observable, measurable behavior. If
    the requirement for test cannot be observed or measured, it can't can be
    assessed to determine if the requirement has been satisfied.</li>
  <li>There is not a one-to-one relationship between each use case or
    supplemental requirement of a system and a requirement for test. Use cases
    will often have more than one requirement for test, while some supplemental
    requirements will derive one or more requirements for test and others will
    derive none (such as marketing or packaging requirements).</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements for test may be derived from many sources, including use
cases, use-case models, supplemental specifications, design requirements,
business cases, interviews with end-users, and the software architecture
document. All of these should be reviewed to gather information that is used to
identify the requirements for test.</p>
<h4><a name="Requirements for Functional Tests">Requirements for Functional
Tests</a> <map name="FPMap2">

<p>Functional requirements for test, as their name implies, are derived from
descriptions of the target-of-test's functional behaviors. At a minimum, each
use case should derive at least one requirement for test. A more detailed list
of requirements for test would include at least one requirement for test for
each use case flow of events.</p>
<h4><a name="Requirements for System Performance Tests">Requirements for
Performance Tests</a> <map name="FPMap3">

<p>Performance requirements for test are derived from the target-of-test's
specified performance behaviors. Typically, performance is stated as a measure
of response time and/or resource usage, as measured under various conditions,
including
<ul>
  <li>different workloads and/or system conditions</li>
  <li>different use cases</li>
  <li>different configurations</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements for performance are described in the Supplementary
Specifications. Review these materials, paying especial attention to statements
that include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>statements of time, such as response time or timing profiles</li>
  <li>statements indicating that a number of events or use cases must occur in a
    stated period of time</li>
  <li>statements comparing the behavior of one item to another</li>
  <li>statements comparing the application behavior on one configuration to that
    of another</li>
  <li>operational reliability (mean time to failure or MTTF) over a period of
    time</li>
  <li>configurations or constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>You should derive at least one requirement for test for each statement in the
specification which reflects information such that listed above.</p>
<h4><a name="Requirements for Reliability Tests">Requirements for Reliability
Tests</a> <map name="FPMap5">

<p>Reliability requirements for test are derived several sources, typically
described in Supplementary Specifications, User-Interface Guidelines, Design
Guidelines, and Programming Guidelines.</p>
<p>Review these artifacts and pay especial attention to statements that include
the following:
<ul>
  <li>statements reliability or resistance to failure, run-time errors (such as
    memory leaks)</li>
  <li>statements indicating code integrity and structure (compliance to language
    and syntax)</li>
  <li>statements regarding resource usage</li>
</ul>
<p>At least one requirement for test should be derived from each statement in
the artifacts that reflects information listed above.</p>
<p>Successful testing requires that the test effort successfully balance factors
such as resource constraints and risks. To accomplish this, the test effort
should be prioritized so that the most important, significant, or riskiest use
cases or components are tested first. To prioritize the test effort, a risk
assessment and operational profile are performed and used as the basis for
establishing the test priority.</p>
<p>The following sections describe how to determine test priority.</p>

Establish Test Priorities</a> <map name="FPMap6">

<p>Identifying the requirements for test is only part of identifying what will
be tested. Prioritizing what will be tested and in what order should also be
performed. This step is done for several reasons, including:
<ul>
  <li>ensure the test efforts are focused on the most appropriate requirements
    for test</li>
  <li>ensure the most critical, significant, or riskiest requirements for test
    are addressed as early as possible</li>
  <li>ensure that any dependencies (sequence, data, etc.) are accounted for in
    the testing</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three steps to assessing risk and establishing the test priorities:

  <li><a href="#Determine Operational Profile">Determine Operational Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Establish Test Priority">Establish Test Priority</a></li>

<p>Guidelines for each of these three steps are provided below:</p>
<h4><a name="Assess Risk">Assess Risk</a> <map name="FPMap7">

<area href="#Top" shape="rect" coords="0, 1, 25, 19"></map><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="top.gif (974 bytes)" border="0" usemap="#FPMap7" width="26" height="20"></h4>
<p>Establishing the priority for test begins with the assessment of risk. Use
cases or components that pose the greatest risk due to failure or have a high
probability of failure should be amongst the first use cases tested.</p>
<p>Begin by identifying and describing the risk magnitude indicators that will
be used, such as:
<ul>
  <li>H - high risk, not tolerable. Severe external exposure. The company will
    suffer great financial losses, liability, or un-recoverable loss of
    reputation.</li>
  <li>M - medium risk, tolerable, but not desirable. Minimal external exposure,
    the company may suffer financially, but there is limited liability or loss
    of reputation.</li>
  <li>L - low risk, tolerable. Little or no external exposure, company has
    little or no financial loss or liability. Company's reputation unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p>After identifying the risk magnitude indicators, list each use case or
component in the target-of-test. For each use case or component in your list,
identify a risk magnitude indicator, and justify (in a brief statement) the
value you selected.</p>
<p>There are three perspectives that can be used for assessing risk:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Effect">Effect</a> - the impact or consequence of a specified
    use case (requirement, etc.) failing</li>
  <li><a href="#Cause">Cause</a> - an undesirable outcome caused by the failure
    of a use case</li>
  <li><a href="#Likelihood">Likelihood</a> - the probability of a use case
    failing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select one perspective, identify a risk magnitude indicator and justify your
selection. It is not necessary to identify an indicator for each risk
perspective. However, it suggested that, if a low indicator was identified, try
evaluating the item from a different risk perspective to ensure the item is
really a low risk.</p>
<p>Below are greater details on assessing risk by these three perspectives.</p>

<p>To assess risk by Effect, identify a condition, event, or action and try to
determine its impact. Ask the question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;What would happen if ___________?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:
<ul>
  <li>&quot;What would happen if while installing the new software, the system
    runs out of disk space?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What would happen if the Internet connection is lost during an
    inquiry transaction?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What would happen if the Internet connection was lost during a
    purchase transaction?&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;What would happen if the user enters an unexpected value?&quot;<br>

<p>Assessing risk by Cause is the opposite of by Effect. Begin by stating an
undesirable event or condition, and identify the set of events that could have
permitted the condition to exist. Ask a question such as:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>For example:
<ul>
  <li>&quot;How could only some of the files be on the system and not all the

  <li>&quot;How could a transaction not be reflected properly in the central

<p>Assessing risk by Likelihood is to determine the probability that a use case
(or component implementing a use case) will fail. The probability is usually
based on an external factors such as:
<ul>
  <li>Failure rate(s) and / or density</li>
  <li>Rate of change</li>
  <li>Complexity</li>
  <li>Origination / Originator</li>

    defect also increases. Discovery rates and density from previous releases

<p>The next step in assessing risk and establishing a test priority is to
determine the target-of-test's operational profile.</p>
<p>Begin by identifying and describing the operational profile magnitude
indicators that will be used, such as:
<ul>
  <li>H - used quite frequently, many times per period or by many actors or use
    cases.</li>
  <li>M - used frequently, several times per period or by several actors or use
    cases.</li>
  <li>L - infrequently used or used by very few actors or use cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operational profile indicator you select should be based upon the
frequency a use case or component is executed, including:
<ul>
  <li>the number of times ONE actor (or use case) executes the use case (or
    component) in a given period of time, or</li>
  <li>the number of ACTORS (or use cases) that execute the use case (or
    component)</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, the greater the number of times a use case or component is used,
the higher the operational profile indicator.</p>
<p>After identifying the operational profile magnitude indicators to be used,
list each use case or component in the target-of-test. Determine an operational
profile indicator for each item in your list and a state your justification for
the indicator value. Information from the workload analysis document (See <a href="../artifact/ar_wlmod.htm">Artifact:
Workload Analysis Document</a>) may be used for this assessment.</p>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li>Installing new software</li>
  <li>Ordering items from the on-line catalog</li>
  <li>Customers inquiring about their order on-line after order is placed</li>
  <li>Item selection dialog</li>

<p>The last step in the assessing risk and establishing a test priority is to
establish the test priority.</p>
<p>Begin by identifying and describing the test priority magnitude indicators
that will be used, such as:
<ul>
  <li>H - must be tested</li>
  <li>M - should be tested, will test only after all H items are tested</li>
  <li>L - might be tested, but not until all H and M items have been tested</li>
</ul>
<p>After identifying the test priority magnitude indicators to be used, list
each use case or component in the target-of-test. Determine a test priority
indicator for each item in your list and a state your justification. Below are
some guidelines for determining a test priority indicator.</p>
<p>Consider the following when determining the test priority indicators for each
item:
<ul>
  <li>the risk magnitude indicator value you identified earlier</li>
  <li>the operational profile magnitude value you identified earlier</li>
  <li>the actor descriptions (are the actors experienced?, tolerant of
    work-arounds?, etc.)</li>
  <li>contractual obligations (will the target-of-test be acceptable if a use
    case or component is not delivered?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies for establishing a test priority include:
<ul>
  <li>Use the highest assessed factor (risk, operational profile, etc.) value
    for each item as the overall priority.</li>
  <li>Identify one assessed factor (risk, operational profile, other) as being
    the most significant and use that factor's value as the priority.</li>
  <li>Use a combination of assessed factors to identify the priority.</li>
  <li>Using a weighting schema where individual factors are weighed, and their
    values and priority calculated based upon the weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li>Installing new software</li>
  <li>Ordering items from the on-line catalog</li>
  <li>Customers inquiring about their order on-line after order is placed</li>
  <li>Item Selection Dialog</li>

<p>Example:</p>

  <p>Functional Test:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>For each use case flow of events, a representative set of transactions
      will identified, each representing the actions taken by the actor when the

      negative (unacceptable) condition.</li>
    <li>In the first iteration, use cases 1 - 4, and 12 will be tested, in the
      following manner:
      <ul>
        <li>Use Case 1:
          <ul>
            <li>Use Case 1 begins with the actor already logged into the

            <li>Each test case will be implemented and executed using Rational
              Robot.</li>
            <li>Verification and assessment of execution for each test case will
              be done using the following methods:
              <ul>
                <li>Test script execution (did each test script execute
                  successfully and as desired?)</li>
                <li>Window Existence, or Object Data verification methods
                  (implemented in the test scripts) will be used to verify that
                  key windows display and specified data is captured / displayed
                  by the target-of-test during test execution.</li>
                <li>The target-of-test's database (using Microsoft Access) will
                  be examined before the test and again after the test to verify
                  that the changes executed during the test are accurately
                  reflected in the data.</li>

  <p>Performance Test:
  <ul>
    <li>For each use case, a representative set of transactions, as identified
      in the workload analysis document will be implemented and executed using
      Rational Suite PerformanceStudio (vu scripts) and Rational Robot (GUI scripts).</li>
    <li>At least three workloads will be reflected in the test scripts and test
      execution schedules including the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Stressed workload: 750 users (15 % managers, 50 % sales, 35 %
          marketing)</li>
        <li>Peak workload: 350 users (10 % managers, 60 % sales, 30 % marketing)</li>

          marketing)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Test scripts used to execute each transaction will include the
      appropriate timers to capture response times, such as total transaction
      time (as defined in the workload analysis document), and key transaction
      activity or process times.</li>
    <li>The test scripts will execute the workloads for one hour (unless noted
      differently by the workload analysis document).</li>
    <li>Verification and assessment of execution for each test execution (of a
      workload) will include:
      <ul>
        <li>Test execution will be monitored using state histograms (to verify
          that the test and workloads are executing as expected and desired)</li>
        <li>Test script execution (did each test script execute successfully and

<p>Completion criteria are stated to for two purposes:
<ul>
  <li>identify acceptable product quality</li>
  <li>identify when the test effort has been successfully implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>A clear statement of completion criteria should include the following items:
<ul>
  <li>function, behavior, or condition being measured</li>
  <li>method of measurement</li>
  <li>criteria or degree of conformance to measurement</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 1
<ul>
  <li>All planned test cases have been executed</li>
  <li>All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution</li>
  <li>All planned test cases have been re-executed and all known defects have
    been addressed as agreed upon, and no new defects have been discovered</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2
<ul>
  <li>All high priority test cases have been executed.</li>
  <li>All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution.</li>
  <li>All Severity 1 or 2 defects have been resolved (status = fixed or
    postponed).</li>
  <li>All high priority test cases have been re-executed and all known defects
    have addressed as agreed upon, and no new defects have been discovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 3
<ul>
  <li>All planned test cases have been executed.</li>
  <li>All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution.</li>
  <li>All Severity 1 or 2 defects have been resolved (status = verified or
    postponed).</li>
  <li>All high priority test cases have been re-executed and all known defects
    have addressed as agreed upon, and no new defects have been discovered.</li>

<p>This section should identify any influences or dependencies which may impact
or influence the test effort describe in the test strategy. Influences might
include:
<ul>
  <li>human resources (such as availability or need for non-test resources to
    support / participate in test)</li>
  <li>constraints, (such as equipment limitations or availability, or the need /
    lack of special equipment)</li>
  <li>special requirements, such as test scheduling or access to systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li>Test databases will require the support of a database designer /
    administrator to create, update, and refresh test data.</li>
  <li>System performance testing will use the servers on the existing network
    (which supports non-test traffic). Testing will need to be scheduled after
    hours to ensure no non-test traffic on the network.</li>
  <li>The target-of-test must synchronize the legacy system (or synchronization
    simulated) for full functional testing to be implemented and executed</li>
</ul>
