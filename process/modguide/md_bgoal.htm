<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>


<p>Traditionally, business activities have been planned and measured with a very 
  strong focus on financial performance. On the one hand, managers may define 
  both financial and nonfinancial objectives, while on the other hand they might 
  be interested only in the outcome of the financial measures.&nbsp;This misalignment 
  between objectives and measures leads, sadly, to undesirable yet predictable 
  behavior.</p>
<p>The modern enterprise does not only have to be competitive financially, but 
  to be so on a variety of different fronts. Business goals must define more than 
  just financial measures. They must also focus on, for example, employee satisfaction 
  or customer success. Simply defining different business goals is not enough 
  to ensure success, because certain goals might be measured or enforced more 
  than others.</p>

<p>Modeling business
goals provides a technique for considering how the business strategy should be
implemented in the short- and long-term and for defining a balanced set of
measures to ensure that business processes support the strategy.</p>
<p>The question that arises from this issue is: How do you implement strategy, 
  particularly one that could require radical change?</p>

<h3><a name="Business Strategy and Business Goals"></a>Business Strategy and
Business Goals <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Business strategy defines the manner in which the organization should interact 
  with its environment, so as to fulfill its purpose. As such, business strategy 
  is essentially focused on the external perspective of the organization, rather 
  than internally managing the organization. Business strategy and business goals 
  are closely related: Business goals define what needs to be achieved to realize 
  a higher-level goal, while business strategy provides the boundaries within 
  which these goals will be defined. Strategy does not, however, prescribe specific 
  goals. </p>


<p>Strategy is about <b>positioning</b>. In military terms, strategy organizes 
  the preparation for battle and the results of the battle, and ensures that results 
  of a battle contribute to achieving the purpose of the war [<a href="../referenc.htm#CLA97">CLA97</a>]. 
  The battle itself is a tactical affair. In business, strategy describes the 
  desired competitive position of the organization. The organization can fulfill 
  its purpose once it finds itself in a sustainable competitive position. Business 
  goals describe what must be achieved to reach that desired competitive position. 
  Both business strategy and business goals are concerned with <b>what</b> must 
  be achieved and not how it will be achieved.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Kenichi Ohmae defines strategy as being anything that gives an organization 
  sustainable competitive advantage [<a href="../referenc.htm#OHM91">OHM91</a>]. 
  Business goals should therefore focus on what provides competitive advantage 
  to the organization, for only this is strategic. We can conclude that business 
  goals must define what must be achieved in order to reach a sustainable competitive 
  position. </p>


<h3><a name="Business Goal Hierarchy"></a>Business Goal Hierarchy <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Business goals are usually high level and have a long-term focus. However, 
  business goals need to be translated to a concrete, measurable level before 
  they can be used to manage the activities of the business. Such a measurable 
  and time-constrained business goal is often referred to as an objective. Business 
  goals therefore need to be arranged in a hierarchy, with each business goal 
  (or objective) traced back to the higher level goals it&nbsp;supports. In [<a href="../referenc.htm#KAP96">KAP96</a>] 
  Kaplan and Norton explain, &quot;Without such linkage, individuals and departments 
  can optimize their local performance but not contribute to achieving strategic 
  objectives.&quot;</p>

<p> While Kaplan and Norton introduce the concept of linkage, they do not supply 
  any further notions or methods to support their concept.&nbsp;It is imperative 
  to obtain clear insight into this hierarchy of business goals and how it is 
  supported by the activities of the business (as described in the Business Use 
  Cases). This allows for rapidly propagating changes in direction from the strategic 
  level downward. This ability to rapidly change the direction of the entire operation 
  is called <b>strategic agility, </b>and it allows the organization to react 
  to changes faster than its competitors.<o:p> </o:p> </p>

<p>Here is an example of a business goal hierarchy in a payment services organization:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bgo1.gif"></p>
<p>The high-level business goal Customer Intimacy
has been translated to business goals at a lower level, which
are more recognizable to individual departments within the organization. By defining
these more concrete business goals, the problem of objectively measuring
customer intimacy is solved. Sometimes it may be necessary to translate one or
more of these lower goals further.</p>


<h3><a name="Business Processes and Business Goals"></a>Business Processes and
Business Goals <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Goals are useless in themselves. They must be translated into action in order 
  to be meaningful. Every business goal should be directly supported by at least 
  one business process, or should be further defined in terms of more concrete 
  subgoals.</p>
<p>It has always been difficult to define a business strategy and then derive 
  objectives in support of this strategy for different parts of the organization. 
  Business processes in the modern enterprise are integrated and cross-functional, 
  and this actually makes the process of allocating business goals easier than 
  before. Business goals are allocated to parts of the organizational in terms 
  of these integrated business processes, which add value to stakeholders of the 
  business. The contribution of one particular part of the organization to customer 
  satisfaction, for example, can be defined and measured.</p>

<h3><a name="Balanced Scorecard"></a>Balanced Scorecard<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>The answer to the question posed above must be sought in a method that gives 
  the user insight into the course of action taken. The method must also&nbsp;indicate 
  to the user the consequences of any action taken. One such method is the Balanced 
  Scorecard (BSC) by Kaplan and Norton [<a href="../referenc.htm#KAP96">KAP96</a>]. 
  The BSC defines a technique for translating business strategy into business 
  goals and measures, thereby ensuring a balanced focus on achievement of all 
  goals.<o:p> </p>
<p>Kaplan and Norton write: &quot;Front-line employees must understand the financial 
  consequences of their decisions and actions; senior executives must understand 
  the drivers of long-term financial success. The objectives and measures of the 
  Balanced Scorecard are ... derived from a top-down process driven by the mission 
  and strategy of the business.&quot; </p>
<p>The theory behind the
BSC is quite logical:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;
     page-break-after:avoid;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Know 
    where you want the organization to be in the future (desired competitive position). 
  </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;
     page-break-after:avoid;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Know 
    the business and the sort of organization required to reach that position 
    (purpose, or mission). </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;
     page-break-after:avoid;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Define 
    the relationship between the mission and the activities of the business (business 
    goals). </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;
     page-break-after:avoid;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Define more precisely what is to be achieved and when the results are to be
	accomplished (operational objectives).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Business goals are scored using four perspectives. It could be concluded that 
  there are only four types of business goals. However the method of scoring and 
  thus the types&nbsp;of business goals is arbitrary. An organization is free 
  to define more types as they are required.</p>

<p><b>Financial Perspective</b>—Indicates what has happened in the past and measures 
  what should be done to achieve the financial objectives and check the performance.</p>

<p><b>Customer Perspective</b>—Looks at the present and indicates what should 
  be done to improve customer relationship.</p>

<p><b>Learning and Growth Perspective</b>—Looks at the future and what needs to 
  be done to maintain growth and achieve further improvement.</p>

<p><b>Internal Process Perspective</b>—Looks at the present and indicates which 
  internal processes should be performed with excellence for customer and shareholder 
  satisfaction.</p>

<p>An important feature of the BSC is that there should be a cause-and-effect 
  relationship between all the perspectives and hence also between all the identified 
  business goals. The following simple but effective example illustrates this.</p>

</div>
<p><br>
  This is an iterative process, because maintaining or improving profitability 
  will enable the organization to keep employing sufficient qualified staff. As 
  Kaplan and Norton indicate, &quot;If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage 
  it.”&nbsp; It is imperative therefore that business goals can be measured objectively, 
  either quantitatively or qualitatively. (See the next section.)</p>

<h3><a name="Measuring Goal Achievement"></a>Measuring Goal Achievement <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p> Just the intention to achieve goals is not enough to ensure that the business 
  strategy will be executed. People must receive feedback on their actions in 
  order to learn and improve.&nbsp; By measuring the achievement of business goals, 
  business activities can be increasingly aligned with strategy. In [<a href="../referenc.htm#ERI00">ERI00</a>], 
  Eriksson and Penker identify quantitative goals and qualitative goals. Quantitative 
  goals are easy to measure, because some attribute must have a particular value 
  at some point in time. Qualitative goals, however, are more subjective ,and 
  human judgment is needed to determine whether the goal has been achieved.</p>
<p>Measurements are useful for a number of reasons. First, measurements provide 
  an indication of how successfully the business strategy is being implemented 
  at various levels of the business. Second, measurements give insight into the 
  effectiveness of goals. Finally, measurements provide a feedback mechanism with 
  which minor adjustments can be made to the strategy based on operating conditions. 
  This feedback can also be accumulated and aggregated over a long period with 
  which the strategy can be adjusted more significantly.<o:p> </o:p> </p>
<p>If business goals are not translated to sufficiently
measurable levels within the organization, they may remain too abstract for
employees to relate to, which will make it very unlikely that people will strive
to achieve the goals in their daily activities.</p>

<h3><a name="Resolving Goal Conflicts"></a>Resolving Goal Conflicts <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Due to the diverse nature of business goals, they may appear to conflict with 
  one another. A typical example is for call-center employees to service many 
  customers in a specific time (throughput), yet deliver high quality of service 
  to each customer (which takes time). If the call-center manager rewards the 
  employee with the most calls, the service level will drop. On the other hand, 
  if the manager rewards the employee with the most satisfied customers, the throughput 
  will drop. Volume versus time or quality versus cost are recognizable goal-conflict 
  patterns to which Eriksson and Penker refer. They also described a technique, 
  using an association stereotyped &laquo;contradictory&raquo;, for explicitly 
  modeling conflicts between business goals.</p>
<p>Managers must be aware of this very common dilemma when setting business goals. 
  However, the strategy of an organization does not stand or fall on any single 
  business goal, much the same as a war is not won or lost by a single battle. 
  The direction of the organization is derived from the sum of all actions taken. 
  It may therefore seem that a business goal is counter-productive, but when the 
  goal is measured as one part of the whole, the sum is actually positive. This 
  means that localized inefficiencies may actually contribute indirectly to the 
  business strategy. Nonetheless, not performing a minor &quot;course correction&quot; 
  (because for example, somebody is more interested in the bonus as a result of 
  the performance of his or her own department) can put the organization as a 
  whole at a disadvantage.</p>


<h3><a name="Example"></a>Example <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Imagine a large furniture store that sells reasonable quality furniture at 
  a reasonable price to the very large middle-market. The store's showrooms border 
  on a warehouse at which customers can directly pick up the item they have purchased 
  and take it with them. Alternatively, customers can arrange to have large items 
  delivered. A business goal hierarchy for this company may look as follows:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bgo2.gif"></p>

<p>Note that the business goal Reasonable Quality is sufficient to retain existing 
  customers but will not serve to attract new customers. People will not go to 
  shop somewhere because the quality is no less than competitors. People will 
  be attracted to shopping there because prices are lower and it is convenient.</p>
<p>It may have been determined that product quality meets customers' expectations 
  and that no quality improvements are therefore necessary. However, facilities 
  may need to be improved. The business goal Improve Facility Quality may be further 
  divided into things like Sufficient Parking, Clean Restrooms, and Multilingual 
  Signs.</p>
<p>Remember that it should be possible to measure business goals; otherwise they 
  may need to be refined further. Prices can be objectively compared to competitors' 
  prices, whereas convenience for customers is very difficult to measure. Therefore, 
  customer convenience has been subdivided into Accessibility, Immediate Availability, 
  and Opening Times, which are more concrete ways to measure customer convenience. 
  Opening Times can be optimized, for example, by measuring the number of people 
  in the store during every hour of the day. Accessibility can be (partly) determined 
  by the number of payment methods available to customers. The immediate availability 
  of products is defined by the stock-on-hand, which can be measured by the percentage 
  of back orders directly requested by customers, and the delivery time, which 
  can also be objectively measured.</p>

<h3><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>An organization has a vision, which is translated into a strategy.&nbsp; The 
  strategy should be met by the business goals that are ultimately measured in 
  the operations of the organization. The vision is implemented by business workers 
  and business actors interacting to realize the business use cases. Business 
  goals are the “glue” between the business strategy and business use cases. If 
  they are correctly defined, they will give the organization the required insight 
  to keep on course or to change course as required.</p>
<p> Business goals must be defined at a sufficiently high level in order to focus 
  the entire organization on the vision. Objectives and measures must be defined 
  at a sufficiently low level within an organization in order that employees can 
  identify themselves with them. Business goals must be measurable to be effective, 
  either quantitatively or by the sum of subgoals (qualitatively).</p>


<p>There are a number of techniques for defining and measuring business
goals, one of which is the Balanced Scorecard. Whatever technique is used,
however, it should be applied as a management tool and not solely as a measurement instrument.</p>
