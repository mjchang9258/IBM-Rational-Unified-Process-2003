<p>In Inception, the top risks are often either business risks or technical
risks. The dominant business risk early on is typically ensuring project
funding. Thus, a proof of concept prototype is often the result of the inception
phase. The proof of concept prototype either demonstrates key functionality or
some essential technology.</p>
<p>The first iteration of a new product is usually the hardest. There are many
new aspects a first iteration must achieve besides producing software: For
example, putting in place the process, team-building, understanding a new
domain, becoming familiar with new tools, and so on. Be conservative in your
expectations about how much of the architecture you can flesh out, or the degree
of usable functionality you can achieve. If you aim too high, you risk delaying
the completion of the first iteration, reducing the total number of iterations,
and hence decreasing the benefit of an iterative approach. The first iterations
should be focused on getting the architecture right. You must therefore involve
the software architects in the planning process of early iterations.</p>

Iterations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In Elaboration, the iterations focus on defining a stable architecture, on
designing and implementing the essential behavior of the system and exploring
the technical architectural issues through a series of architectural prototypes.
&quot;Architecturally significant&quot; scenarios are sub-flows which exercise
the architecture of the system in defining ways.</p>

<p>Toward the end of Elaboration, and during Construction and Transition, change
requests (also known as Software Change Orders or SCO's) begin to drive the
iteration process. SCO's result from:
<ul>
  <li>enhancement requests</li>
  <li>change requests whose scope goes beyond the individual package or class.</li>
  <li>changes in the iteration scope and objectives.</li>
  <li>changes in requirements either proposing that the requirements baseline be
    changed, or accommodating an accepted change to the requirements baseline.</li>
</ul>
<p>These SCO's are balanced against the existing project plan, iteration plans,
and the existing risk list. SCO's may cause the priority of requirements to be
re-evaluated, or may drive the re-prioritization of risk. SCO's must be managed
carefully, however, lest project control be lost.</p>
<p>During Construction and Transition, the focus is on fleshing-out the
architecture and implementing all remaining requirements.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_iteration__strategies"></a><a name="Iteration Strategies">Iteration
Strategies</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unlike the Waterfall model, where the entire system is considered at once, we
only consider a portion of the functionality of the system in each iteration.
During each iteration, a subset of the total system is analyzed, designed and
implemented. The choice of what the subset should be and how deep to delve are
critical to reducing risk in subsequent iterations. There are two basic
strategies: Wide/Shallow and Narrow/Deep.</p>
<h4><a name="Wide and Shallow">Wide and Shallow</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In the Wide/Shallow strategy, the entire problem domain is analyzed, but only
the surface details are considered. All Use Cases are defined and most are
fleshed-out in great detail, to get a clear understanding of the problem at
hand. The architecture is defined broadly as well, and the key mechanisms and
services offered by architectural components are defined; the interfaces of
subsystems are defined, but their internal details are detailed only where
significant risk or uncertainty must be managed. Very little is implemented
until Construction, where most of the iteration occurs.</p>
<p>The Wide/Shallow strategy is appropriate when:
<ul>
  <li>The Team is inexperienced, either in the problem domain or in a technology
    area (including methodology or process).</li>
  <li>Sound architecture is a key requirement for future capability, and the
    architecture is unprecedented.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategy has some potential pitfalls, however:
<ul>
  <li>The team can get trapped in <b>analysis paralysis</b> (the illogical
    feeling that unless the design is perfect, one cannot implement anything).</li>
  <li>Early results are often needed to build confidence and credibility; the
    longer the project team goes without producing something executable, the
    less confident they feel about their ability to do so.</li>
  <li>Not enough of the technical details and challenges of the architecture are
    exposed to get a sense of the real technical risks</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Narrow and Deep">Narrow and Deep</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In the Narrow/Deep strategy, a <i>slice </i>of the problem domain is
analyzed thoroughly. The Use Cases related to this narrow slice are defined and
fleshed-out in great detail, to get a clear understanding of the problem at
hand. The architecture required to support the desired behavior is defined, and
the system is designed and implemented. Subsequent iterations focus on
analyzing, designing and implementing additional vertical slices.</p>
<p>The Narrow/Deep strategy is appropriate when:
<ul>
  <li>Early results need to be demonstrated to overcome a dominant risk, garner
    support or prove viability.</li>
  <li>Requirements are continually evolving, making it difficult to completely
    define all requirements before starting detailed design and implementation
    work.</li>
  <li>The deadline is <b>mandatory</b>, such that getting an early start on
    development is key to successful delivery.</li>
  <li>A high degree of re-use is possible, enabling a greater degree of
    incremental delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The strategy is not without drawbacks:
<ul>
  <li>There is a tendency with this strategy for each iteration to develop
    software that is vertically integrated but horizontally incompatible. This
    is sometimes referred to as the <b>stovepipe</b> syndrome, and it makes a
    system difficult to integrate.</li>
  <li>It is not well-suited to developing systems in a completely new problem
    domain or based on an unprecedented architecture, since a large part of the
    functionality of a system must be sampled in order to achieve a balanced
    architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Lessons Learned from Experience">Lessons Learned from Experience</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Generally, early iterations will have more of a Wide/Shallow flavor, while
later iterations (where a stable architecture has been developed) tend to follow
the Narrow/Deep strategy.</p>
<p>The first iteration is usually the hardest, since it requires the entire
development environment and much if the project team to be in place. Tool
integration and team-building issues add to the complexity of the first
iteration. Focusing on the architectural issues can help to maintain focus and
prevents the team from getting bogged down in details too early.</p>
<h4><a name="Hybrid Strategies">Hybrid Strategies</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Narrow/Deep strategy used in Inception
    <p>Where exploitation of a new technology is essential to the fundamental
    viability of the project.&nbsp; Many e-business projects require new
    technologies to be explored to a much greater depth than might be done
    traditionally.&nbsp; The proof-of-concept prototype is still considered a
    &quot;throw-away&quot;, and merely explores the viability of the project
    concept.</li>
  <li>Wide/Shallow strategy used in Inception
    <p>This strategy is pursued to gain an understanding of the
    scope of the system, and to sample the breadth of functionality of the
    system to ensure that the architecture is capable of delivering the desired
    capabilities.</li>
  <li>Wide/Shallow strategy used in Elaboration
    <p>This approach can help develop a sound architecture, with selective
    Narrow/Deep focus to address specific technical risks. In Construction, with
    a sound architecture established, the focus can return to Narrow/Deep, where
    functionality is developed and delivered in a series of integrated
    increments.</li>
  <li>Narrow/Deep strategy used in Construction
    <p>Construction iterations are always Narrow/Deep, with teams working in
    parallel to develop and deliver the required functionality.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Special Considerations for New Teams">Special Considerations for
New Teams</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>New teams are typically overly optimistic at first with what they can
accomplish. To counter this, and to avert potential morale problems which occur
when actual results fall short of optimistic expectations, be modest in the
amount of functionality that can be achieved in the first iteration. Try to
build experience while creating a sense of accomplishment and project momentum.</p>
<p>If the development environment and/or methods are new to the team, reduce the
functionality of the first iteration to a minimum. Focus on integrating and
tuning the environment and becoming proficient with the tools, then ramp-up the
functionality content in subsequent iterations.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_rework__as_part_of_iterations"></a><a name="Expected Rework">Expected
Rework</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Rework is good, up to a point. One of the major benefits of an iterative
development is precisely to allow mistakes and experimentation, but early enough
so that corrective actions can be taken. However technical people in particular
tend to 'gold plate' or redo work to perfection between one iteration and the
next.</p>
<p>At the end of each iteration, during the iteration assessment, the team
should decide what part of the current release will be reworked. Expect rework
to be allocated among phases in the following percentages, relative to the total
system:
<ul>
  <li>Inception, 40%-100% - this is where you may develop throwaway, exploratory
    prototypes</li>
  <li>Elaboration, 25%-60% in early iterations; less than 25% in later
    iterations, or for an evolution cycle.</li>
  <li>Construction, after the architecture baseline, 10% or less per iteration
    and 25% total.</li>
  <li>Transition, less than 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rework is inevitable. When no one sees the need for rework, you should be
suspicious. This may be due to:
<ul>
  <li>Excessive pressure schedule.</li>
  <li>Lack of real test or assessment.</li>
  <li>Lack of motivation or focus.</li>
  <li>Negative perception of rework as being bad, waste of resources, or an
    admission of incompetence or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Too much rework is alarming. This may be due to 'gold plating' or to an
unacceptable level of requirement changes. A business case must be done to
evaluate the necessity of some rework.<p>Note that we do <i>not</i> include work
de-scoped from the previous iteration (because of the timeboxed approach to
iteration management) in the category of 'rework'. The Project Manager has to
include this de-scoped work in the pool of functionality from which to define
the next iteration's contents. Obviously, such work will normally have high
priority. The Project Manager should also discover and carefully consider the
reasons for the failure of the previous iteration to achieve its planned goals.
For example, although we do not advise the arbitrary addition of staff in a
desperate attempt to meet a schedule, running a project chronically <i>understaffed</i>
- while repeatedly making ambitious plans for each iteration - is not sensible
either. It usually leads to poor team morale and an angry customer. The right
balance has to be found, and estimation models such as COCOMO II (see [<a href="../referenc.htm#BOE00">BOE00</a>])
can help with this. With each iteration, a project builds a history of
achievement - of productivity and quality. A strong indicator for a Project
Manager, in planning the next iteration, is what was achieved in the previous
one.
<h3><a name="Level of Planning">Level of Planning</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>When the first-cut iteration plan is complete, the team leads, perhaps in conjunction 
  with the project manager, can refine it into a working plan at the activity 
  level. The included <a href="../../prjtmpl/index.htm">Microsoft&reg; Project 
  Templates</a> (at the activity level) show how this might appear. Note though 
  that these working plans are derived from the iteration plan, they are not separately 
  produced, independent artifacts. It is important - if the project manager is 
  to keep control - that the working plans can be rolled-up to status the project 
  manager's iteration plan.</p>
