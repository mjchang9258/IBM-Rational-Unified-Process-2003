<p>Nothing has a greater influence on the project teams ability to ensure the 
  stakeholder's satisfaction with the software, than the availability of a clear 
  specification of what the stakeholders expectations are. With or without a good 
  enough set of requirements specifications, test cases are one artifact that 
  helps to reflect the expectations of the stakeholders, enabling those expectations 
  to be verified and validated.</p>
<p>When a useful set of requirements are available, the test team needs to plan 
  tests that will appropriately validate those requirements. Note that validating 
  the software against the requirements may be done differently depending on the 
  type of requirement. For example, executing the software to validate its functional 
  and performance requirements may be done by a tester using automated test techniques, 
  while verifying a configuration requirement such as the shutdown of the host 
  computer system may need to be done using manual testing techniques.</p>
<p>Since you may not be able (or be responsible) to verify all requirements, it 
  is important to focus on the most appropriate or critical requirements for the 
  scope of the current work effort. The requirements you choose to verify will 
  be a balance between the cost, risk, and necessity of having the requirement 
  verified, and will generally be limited by the scope of the current iteration.</p>
<p>While requirements are an important source from which tests can be derived, 
  they are not the only information source. In fact, in many cases they will be 
  insufficient to provide a complete basis from which tests are developed. Test 
  Cases should also be considered that are based on information sources such as 
  risks, constraints, technologies, change requests (defects), faults and so on.<br>
  See <a href="../workflow/test/co_tstidslst.htm">Concept: Test Ideas</a> for 
  more information on how to come up with ideas from which tests can be derived. 
</p>
<p>Identifying test cases is useful for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test cases can be used as the foundation on which to design and implement 
    the actual tests. Time spent considering the test case helps to understand 
    the design and implementation requirements better, and has the potential to 
    save time in design and implementation activities.</li>
  <li>Some tests are particularly complex or detailed. Tests of this nature can 
    benefit from careful consideration in advance before starting implementation 
    of the test, and test case and test design artifacts are good tools for exploring 
    those considerations. </li>
  <li>The &quot;depth&quot; of the testing is typically regarded as proportional 
    to the number of tests. Greater confidence in the test process itself is often 
    gained when the potential &quot;depth&quot; of testing can be reasoned about 
    based on the number of test cases identified.</li>
  <li>One measure of the completeness of the test effort is based on monitoring 
    coverage against some set of motivating elements. Coverage reporting can be 
    based on measures such as the number test cases identified, and the number 
    of tests implemented and / or executed against each test case, or the amount 
    of effort expended against each test case.</li>
  <li>The scale and complexity of the test effort is to some extent proportional 
    to the number of test cases. With a breakdown of test cases, the test effort 
    can be reasoned about at a finer level of granularity.</li>
  <li>The kinds of test design and development, and the resources needed are in 
    part governed by the number and complexity of the test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some concerns worth considering regarding test cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not every test is complex enough to warrant the overhead of creating a test 
    case artifact that needs to be reviewed and maintained: the test is simple 
    enough that a short textual description is enough to convey what is required. 
    In fact, the majority of test cases may fall in the category. Time spent documenting 
    a vast number of simple test cases may result in time lost from more important 
    testing activities.</li>
  <li>Some of the initial ideas you have for tests are subsequent proven to be 
    flawed in some respect. This means that some of the test cases you initially 
    identified based on those ideas will be abandoned. This reality means that 
    any work you do documenting test cases in detail may be subsequently abandoned, 
    and any reporting of coverage based on test cases needs to consider that situation. 
    As such, it may be better to base test coverage reporting on the basis of 
    higher-level concerns than test cases, and to treat test cases as internal 
    test team artifacts used as required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test cases are often categorized or classified by the type of test or requirement 
  for test they are associated with, and will vary accordingly. One heuristic 
  for identifying test cases is to start by considering the following two perspectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>demonstrating the requirement has been achieved, often referred to as a 
    positive test case,</li>
  <li>demonstrating the requirement is <b>only</b> achieved under the desired 
    conditions, referred to as a negative test. This test case reflects unacceptable, 
    abnormal, or unexpected conditions or data that the software may reasonably 
    be subjected to.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="DerivingTestCasesFromUseCases">Deriving Test Cases from Use Cases</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Test cases for functional testing are derived from the target-of-test's use 
  cases (see <a href="../artifact/ar_uc.htm">Artifact: Use Case</a>). Test cases 
  should be developed for each use-case scenario. The use-case scenarios are identified 
  by describing the paths through the use case that traverse the basic flow and 
  alternate flows start to finish through the use case.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, for example, each of the different paths through a use 
  case reflecting the basic and alternate flows, are represented with the arrows. 
  The basic flow, represented by the straight, black-line is the simplest path 
  through the use case. Each alternate flow begins with the basic flow and then, 
  dependent upon a specific condition, the alternate flow is executed. Alternate 
  flows may rejoin the basic flow (alternate flows 1 and 3), may originate from 
  another alternate flow (alternate flow 2), or may terminate the use case without 
  rejoining a flow (alternate flows 2 and 4).</p>

<p align="center" class="picturetext">Sample Flows of Events for a use case</p>

<p align="left">Following each possible path through the use case in the above 
  diagram, the different use-case scenarios can be identified. Beginning with 
  the basic flow and then combining the basic flow with alternate flows, the following 
  use-case scenarios can be identified:&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOTE:&nbsp;For simplicity, Scenarios 5, 6, and 8 only depict a single execution 
  of the loop indicated by Alternate flow 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deriving the test cases for each scenario is done by identifying the specific 
  condition that will cause that specific use-case scenario to be executed.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the use case depicted in the diagram above stated the 
  following for Alternate Flow 3:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;This flow of events occurs if the dollar amount entered in Step 2 above, 
  &quot;Enter Withdraw Amount&quot; is greater than the current account balance. 
  The system displays a warning message and then rejoins the basic flow at Step 
  2 &quot;Enter Withdraw Amount&quot; above, where the bank customer can enter 
  a new withdrawal amount.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>With this information, you can begin to identify the test cases needed to execute 
  the alternate flow 3:</p>

  table above.</p>
<p>For each of these seven scenarios, test cases need to be identified. Test cases 
  can be identified and managed using matrices or decision tables. A common format 
  is shown below, where each row represent an individual test case, and the columns 
  identify test case information.&nbsp; In this example, for each test case, there 
  is a test case ID, Condition (or description), and all the data elements participating 
  in the test case (as input or already in the database), and expected result.</p>
<p>To begin developing the matrix, start by identifying what data elements are 
  required to execute the use-case scenarios. Then, for each scenario, identify 
  at least test case that contains the appropriate condition to execute the scenario. 
  For example, in the matrix below, V (valid) is used to indicate this condition

<p>In the matrix above, the six test cases execute the four scenarios. For the 
  Basic Flow, test case CW1 above is known as a positive test case. It executes 
  the Basic Flow path through the use case without any deviations. Comprehensive 
  testing of the Basic Flow must include negative test cases to ensure that the 
  Basic Flow is taken only when the conditions are correct. These negative test 
  cases are represented by test cases CW2 - 6 (the shaded cell indicates the condition 
  needed to execute the alternate flows).&nbsp;While CW2 - 6 are negative test 
  cases for the Basic Flow, they are positive test cases for Alternate flows 2 
  - 4, and there is at least one negative test case each of these Alternate Flows 
  (CW1 - the Basic Flow).</p>
<p>Scenario 4 is an example where having just one positive and one negative test 
  case per scenario is not sufficient. To thoroughly test Scenario 4 - Incorrect 
  PIN, at least three positive test cases (to invoke Scenario 4) are needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the incorrect PIN is entered and there are tries left and this Alternate 
    Flow rejoins the Basic Flow Step 3 - Enter PIN)</li>
  <li>the incorrect PIN is entered and there are no remaining tries left and
    this Alternate Flow then retains the card and terminates the use case.</li>
  <li>the CORRECT PIN is entered when there are no remaining tries left.&nbsp;
    This Alternate Flow rejoins the Basic Flow at Step 5 - Enter Amount.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice, that in the above matrix, no actual values were entered for the conditions 
  (data). An advantage of creating the test case matrix in this manner is that 
  it is easy to see what conditions are being tested. It is also very easy to 
  determine if sufficient test cases have been identified, since you only need 
  to look at Vs and Is (or as done here - shaded cells). Looking at the above 
  table, there are several conditions for which there is no shaded cell, therefore, 
  we are missing test cases, such as for Scenario 6 - No Account or Incorrect 
  Account Type and Scenario 7 - Insufficient Account Balance.</p>
<p>One all the test cases have been identified, they should be reviewed and validated 
  to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and eliminate redundant or equivalent test 
  cases. See <a href="../activity/chklists/ck_tstcs.htm">Checkpoints: Test Case</a> 
  for more details. Also see the section <a href="#DefiningTestDataForTestCases">Defining 
  Test Data for Test Cases</a> for additional details.</p>

<p>The test cases above are only a few of the test cases needed to verify the 
  Cash Withdraw Use Case for this iteration. Other test cases needed include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scenario 6 - No Account or Incorrect Account Type: Account not found or
    available</li>
  <li>Scenario 6 - No Account or Incorrect Account Type: Account does not allow
    withdraws</li>
  <li>Scenario 7 - Insufficient Account Balance: Amount requested greater than
    amount in account.</li>
</ul>
<p>In future iterations, when other flows are implemented, test cases will be 
  needed for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Invalid cards (card is reported lost, stolen, is not from an accepted
    bank, has a damaged stripe, etc.)</li>
  <li>Inability to read a card (card reader is jammed, off-line, or
    malfunctioning)</li>
  <li>Account is closed, frozen, or otherwise unavailable</li>
  <li>Amount in ATM is insufficient or incapable of creating requested amount
    (different than CW3, in that one denomination is out, but not all)</li>
  <li>Incapable of contacting banking system for approval</li>
  <li>Bank network goes off line, or power failure mid-transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>When identifying functional test cases, ensure the following:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>sufficient test cases, positive and negative, have been identified for
    each use-case scenario&nbsp;</li>
  <li>test cases address any business rules implemented by the use cases,
    ensuring that there are test cases inside, outside, and at the boundary
    condition / value for the business rule</li>
  <li>test cases address any sequencing of events or actions, such as those
    identified in the sequence diagrams in the design model, or user interface
    object states or conditions.</li>
  <li>test cases address any special requirements defined for the use case, such
    minimum/maximum performance, sometimes combined with minimum/maximum loads
    or data volumes during the execution of the use cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all requirements for a target-of-test will be reflected in functional requirements 
  artifacts such as use-case specifications. Non-functional requirements, such 
  as performance, security and access, and configuration requirements specify 
  additional behaviors or characteristics of the target-of-test, and are often 
  documented separately from the functional requirements. The Supplementary Specification 
  is one of the primary sources for deriving test cases for these additional requirements.</p>

  Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The primary input for performance test cases are the Supplementary Specifications 
  which contain the non-functional requirements (see <a href="../artifact/ar_sspec.htm">Artifact: 
  Supplementary Specifications</a>). Use the following guidelines when deriving 
  test cases for performance test:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ensure there is at least one test case identified for each statement in
    the supplementary specification which states a performance criteria.
    Performance criteria are usually expressed as time per transaction, number
    of transactions / users, or percentiles.</li>
  <li>ensure there is at least one test case identified for each critical use 
    case. Critical use cases are those identified in the above statements and 
    / or in the workload analysis document that must be evaluated using performance 
    measures.<br>
	
    (see <a href="../artifact/ar_wlmod.htm">Artifact:
    Workload Analysis Document</a>) 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>As with test cases for functional tests, there will typically be more than 
  one test case per usage scenario or requirement. It is common to define multiple 
  test cases - for example, one that is below the performance threshold value 
  (average transaction rate), another at the threshold value (high transaction 
  rate), and a third test case above the threshold value (peak transaction rate).</p>
<p>In addition to the above performance criteria, ensure that you identify the 
  specify conditions that affect response times, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Size of the database - how many records exist?</li>
  <li>Workload - transaction patterns:
    <ul>
      <li>type, number and frequency of simultaneous end-user actions,</li>
      <li>type, number, frequency and duration of simultaneous transactions being 
        performed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Environment characteristics (hardware, netware, software configuration)</li>
</ul>
<p>A common practice is to capture test cases for performance tests in tabular 
  matrices similar to those used for function test.</p>
<p>See the section <a href="#DefiningTestDataForTestCases">Defining Test Data 
  for Test Cases</a> for additional details.</p>

  Security / Access Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Actors and use cases describe the interaction between external users of the 
  system and the actions performed by the system to yield a value to a particular 
  actor. Complex systems contain many actors and it is critical that we develop 
  test cases to ensure that only those actors specified to execute the use cases 
  can do so. This is especially true if there are differences in the use case 
  flow of events based upon actor type.</p>
<p>For example, in the ATM use cases, different use case flow of events may be 
  executed for the actor &quot;Bank Customer&quot; if their card and account is 
  from the bank that owns the ATM versus the &quot;Bank Customer&quot; who uses 
  a bank card (and account) from a competing bank, or tries to use a non-participating 
  bank card.</p>
<p>Follow the same guidelines as listed above for functional test cases.</p>

  Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In typical distributed systems there can be many allowed combinations of hardware 
  and software that will be supported. Testing should be performed to verify that 
  the target-of-test functions or performs acceptably in different configurations, 
  such as with different operating systems, browsers, or CPU speeds. Furthermore, 
  testing also needs to cover combinations of components to uncover defects that 
  come from interactions of the different components, for example, ensuring that 
  the version of DLLs installed by one application do not conflict the versions 
  of the same DLLs expected by another application.</p>
<p>To derive test cases for configuration testing, use the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure there is at least one test case identifying each critical
    configuration. This is done by identifying the required hardware and
    software configurations for the target-of-test's environment and
    prioritizing the configurations, ensuring the most common ones are tested
    first, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Printer support</li>
      <li>Network connections - local and wide area networks</li>
      <li>Server configurations - server drivers, server hardware</li>
      <li>Other software installed on the desktop and / or servers</li>
      <li>Software versions for all installed software</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure there is at least one test case for each configuration likely to 
    have problems. These may include:
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware with the lowest performance.</li>
      <li>Co-resident software that has a history of compatibility problems.</li>
      <li>Clients accessing the server over slowest possible LAN/WAN connection.</li>
      <li>Insufficient resources (slow CPU speed, minimum memory or resolution,
        disk space, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="DerivingTestCasesForInstallationTests">Deriving Test Cases for Installation 
  Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Installation testing needs to verify that the target-of-test can be installed 
  under all possible installation scenarios. Installation scenarios may include 
  installing the target-of-test for the first time, or installing a newer version 
  or build of the target-of-test (onto a machine containing the older version). 
  Install testing should also ensure that the target-of-test performs acceptably 
  when abnormal conditions are encountered, such as insufficient disk space.</p>
<p>The test cases should cover installation scenarios for the software including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distribution media, for example, diskettes, CD-ROM, or file server.</li>
  <li>New installation.</li>
  <li>Complete installation.</li>
  <li>Custom installations.</li>
  <li>Upgrade installations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation programs for client-server software have a specialized set of 
  test cases. Unlike host-based systems, the installation program is typically 
  divided between the server and the client. Therefore, it is important that installation 
  testing perform the installation of all components of the target-of-test, including 
  the client, middle tiers, and servers.</p>

  for other Non-Functional Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Ideally, you should find all the necessary input to derive test cases in the 
  Use-Case Model, the Design Model, and the Supplementary Specification artifacts. 
  It is, however, not uncommon that you at this point need to complement what 
  is found there.</p>
<p>Examples would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test cases for Operational Tests (to verify that the software works when 
    in use for a &quot;long time&quot; between failures).</li>
  <li>Test cases that investigate performance bottlenecks, volume capabilities
    of the system, or stress the target-of-test to failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, you can find these test cases by creating variants or aggregates 
  of the test cases you've derived from those previously identified.</p>


<h3><a name="DerivingTestCasesForAcceptanceTests">Deriving Test Cases for 
  Product Acceptance Tests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Product acceptance testing is the final test action prior to deploying the 
  software. The goal of acceptance testing is to verify that the software is ready 
  and can be used by the end-users to perform those functions and tasks the software 
  was built to do. Product acceptance testing often involves more than execution 
  of the software for readiness, it also involves all product artifacts delivered 
  to the customer(s), such as training, documentation, and packaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deriving test cases for the software artifact(s) is done in the manner described 
  in the sections above. Depending upon the degree and of formality of the product 
  acceptance test, the test cases will either be the same or similar to those 
  identified above (formal), or a subset (informal). Independent of the depth 
  of the test cases, agreement on the test cases and product acceptance criteria 
  should be reached at before product testing is implemented and executed.</p>
<p>Evaluating the non-software artifact(s) varies greatly dependent upon the artifact 
  being evaluated. Refer to each specific non-software artifacts Guidelines and 
  Checklists for information regarding what / how to evaluate it.</p>


<h3><a name="BuildVerificationTestCasesForRegressionTests">Build Verification Test Cases for
    Regression Tests</a><a name="XE_test_case__prioritizing_based_on_risk"></a><a name="XE_prioritizing__test_cases"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Regression testing compares two builds or versions of the same target-of-test
and identifies differences as potential defects. It thus assumes that a new
version should behave like an earlier one and ensures that defects have not been
introduced as a result of the changes.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would like all the test cases in one iteration to be used as test 
  cases in the later iterations. The following guidelines should be used to identify, 
  design, and implement test cases that maximize the value of regression testing 
  and reuse, while minimizing maintenance: 
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the test case identify only the critical data elements (those
    needed to create / support the condition being tested</li>
  <li>Ensure each test case describes or represents a unique set of inputs or
    sequence of events that results in a unique behavior by the target-of-test</li>
  <li>Eliminate redundant or equivalent test cases</li>
  <li>Group together test cases which have the same target-of-test initial state
    and state of the test data</li>
</ul>

  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Once the test cases have been discussed and their is general agreement/ approval 
  for them, the actual data values can be identified in more detail (e.g. in the 
  test case implementation matrix), and the test data artifacts created.</p>
