<p>The Requirements Management Plan contains information which may be covered to
a greater or lesser extent by other plans.&nbsp; See <a href="../artifact/ar_ratgl.htm#Tailoring">Artifact:

<p>As described in the <a href="../../papers/apprmuc.htm">White Paper: Applying
Requirements Management with Use Cases</a>, requirements management is important
to ensuring project success.&nbsp; The most commonly cited causes of project
failure include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of user input</li>
  <li>Incomplete requirements</li>
  <li>Changing requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements errors are also likely to be the most common class of error, and
are the most expensive to fix.</p>
<p>Having the right relationships with stakeholders can help with these
problems.&nbsp; The stakeholders are a key source of input for defining
requirements and understanding priorities of requirements.&nbsp; Many
stakeholders, however, lack the insight into the cost and schedule impacts of
requested features, and therefore the development organization must manage
stakeholders expectations.
<p>Establishing stakeholder relationships includes defining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Responsibilities of the stakeholders: Will staff be available on site for
    consulting? At pre-arranged times?</li>
  <li>Visibility of stakeholders into project artifacts: Open visibility to all
    artifacts?&nbsp; Visibility only at scheduled milestones?</li>
</ul>

<p>Describe traceability items, and define how they are to be named, marked, and
numbered.&nbsp; See <a href="../workflow/requirem/co_reqty.htm">Concepts:
Requirement Types</a>, and <a href="../workflow/requirem/co_trace.htm">Concepts:
Traceability</a>.&nbsp; The most important traceability items are listed in
<a href="../activity/ac_devra.htm">Activity: Develop Requirements Management
Plan</a>.
<h3><a name="XE_requirements_management_plan__specifying_traceability"></a><a name="Specifying Traceability">Specifying Traceability</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p> A
typical traceability, with a limited set of essential artifacts, is described in <a href="../activity/ac_devra.htm">Activity:
Develop Requirements Management Plan</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the traceability links, you should specify the
cardinality of the links.&nbsp; Some common constraints are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each approved product feature must be linked to one or more supplemental
    requirements, or one or more use cases, or both.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Each supplemental requirement and each use case section must be linked to
    one or more test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more detailed discussion of traceability is provided in the white paper <a href="../../papers/traceability.htm">Traceability
Strategies for Managing Requirements With Use Case</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_requirements_management_plan__sample_attributes"></a><a name="Sample Attributes">Sample Attributes</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The following are some example attributes which you may wish to select from,
organized using the requirements types identified in <a href="../activity/ac_devra.htm">Activity:
Develop Requirements Management Plan</a>.</p>
<h4>Stakeholder Need<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Source: </b>The stakeholder originating the requirement.&nbsp; (This may
  also be implemented as a traceability to a &quot;Stakeholder&quot;
  traceability item.</p>
  <p><b>Contribution</b>: Indicates the problem contribution to the overall
  business opportunity or problem being addressed by the project.
  Percentage (0 to 100%). All contributions should sum to no greater than
  100%. Below is an example <a href="../workguid/wg_paret.htm">Pareto
  Diagram</a> showing the contribution for each of several Stakeholder Needs.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="images/pareto.gif" width="501" height="162"></p>
<h4>Features, Supplementary Requirements, and Use Cases<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<blockquote>
<p class="InfoBlue"><b>Status: </b>Indicates whether the requirement has been
reviewed and accepted by the &quot;official channel&quot;. Example values are
Proposed, Rejected, Approved.</p>
<p class="InfoBlue">&nbsp;This may be a contractual status, or a status set by a
working group capable of making binding decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="Benefit">Benefit</a>: </b> The importance from the stakeholder(s)
viewpoint.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Critical</b> (or primary). These have to do with the main tasks of the system,
its basic function, the functions for which it is being developed. If they are
missing the system fails to fulfill its primary mission. They drive the
architectural design and tend to be the most frequently exercised use cases.</li>
  <li><b> Important</b> (or secondary). These have to do with the support of the
system's functions, such as statistical data compilation, report generation,
supervision, and function testing. If they are missing the system can still (for
a while) fulfill its fundamental mission, but with degraded service quality. In
modeling, less importance will be attached to them than to critical use cases</li>
  <li><b> Useful</b> (nice to have). These are &quot;comfort&quot; features, not
linked to the system's primary mission but that help in its use or market
positioning.</li>
</ul>
  <p><b>Effort</b>: Estimated effort days to implement the requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.g. This could be categories such as Low, Medium, High. E.g. Low = &lt;1day,
Medium = 1-20 days, High = &gt;20 days.</p>
  <p>In defining Effort, it should be clearly indicated which overheads
  (management effort, test effort, requirements effort etc.) is included into
  the estimate.</p>
  <p><b>Size</b>: Estimated non-comment source lines of code (SLOCs), excluding
  any test code.</p>
  <p>You may wish to distinguish between new and re-used SLOCs, in order to
  better compute cost estimates.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <b> <a name="Risk"> Risk</a></b>: % likelihood that implementation of the requirement
  will encounter significant undesirable events such as schedule slippage, cost
  overrun, or cancellation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E.g. This could be categories such as Low, Medium, High.&nbsp; E.g. Low =
&lt;10%, Medium = 10-50%, High = &gt;50%.</p>
  <p>Another option for Risk is separately tracking Technology Risk&nbsp; - % likelihood of running into serious difficulty
  implementing the requirement because of lack of experience in the domain
  and/or required technologies.&nbsp; Then overall risk can be computed as a
  weighted sum based on other attributes, including
  size, effort, stability, technology risk, architectural impact, and
  organizational complexity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Organizational</b> <b>Complexity</b>: Categorization of control over the
  organization developing the requirement.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Internal</b>: In-house development at one site</li>
    <li><b>Geographic</b>: Geographically distributed team</li>
    <li><b>External</b>: External organization within the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Vendor</b>: Subcontract or purchase of externally developed software.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><a name="Architectural Impact">Architectural Impact</a>: </b>Indicates how this requirement will impact the
  software architecture.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>None</b>: Does not affect the existing architecture.</li>
    <li><b>Extends</b>: Requires extending the existing architecture.</li>
    <li><b>Modifies</b>: The existing architecture must be changed to accommodate
      the requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Stability:</b> Likelihood that this requirement will change, or that the
  development teams' understanding of the requirement will change. (&gt;50% =
  High, 10..50% = Medium, &lt;10%=Low)</p>
<p><b>Target Release</b>: The intended product release in which the requirement
will be met. (Release1, Release1.1, Release2, ...)</p>
<p><b>Hazard Level / Criticality</b>: Ability to affect health, welfare, or
economic consequences, typically as a result of the software failing to perform
as required.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Negligible</b>: Cannot result in significant
      personnel injury or equipment damage.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Marginal</b>: Can be controlled without personnel
      injury or major system damage.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Critical</b>: Can cause personnel injury or major
      system damage, or will require immediate corrective action for personnel
      or system survival.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Catastrophic</b>: Can cause serious injury or
      death, or complete system loss.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="InfoBlue">Hazards may also be identified as separate requirements
  types, and linked to associated use cases.&nbsp; You may also wish to track
  hazard probability, corrective actions and/or preventative measures.</p>
<p><b>Interpretation</b>: In some cases where the requirements form a formal
contract, it may be difficult and costly to change the wording the requirements.&nbsp; As the development organization gains a
better understanding of a requirement, it may be necessary to attach
interpretation text, rather than simply change the official wording of the
requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Use Case<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In addition to the above, it is also useful to track the following use case
attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>%Detailed</b>: Degree to which the Use Case has been elaborated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>10%</b>: Basic description is provided..</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>50%</b>: Main flows documented.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>80%</b>: Completed but not reviewed.&nbsp; All
      preconditions and postconditions fully specified.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>100%</b>: Reviewed and approved.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>Test Case<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Status: </b>Tracks progress during test development.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>No Activity</b>: No work has been accomplished in
      developing this test case.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Manual</b>: A manual script has been created and
      validated as capable of verifying the associated requirements.</li>
    <li>
      <p class="InfoBlue"><b>Automated</b>: An automated script has been created
      and validated as capable of verifying the associated requirements.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h4>General Attributes<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Some other requirement attributes which have general applicability are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Planned Iteration</li>
  <li>Actual Iteration</li>
  <li>Responsible Party</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="XE_requirements_management_plan__selecting_attributes"></a><a name="Assigning Requirements Attributes">Selecting Attributes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Attributes are used to track information associated with a traceability item,
typically for status and reporting purposes.&nbsp; Each organization may require specific tracking information
unique to their organization.&nbsp; Before assigning an attribute,
you should consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who will supply this information?</li>
  <li>Who will use this information, and why is it useful?</li>
  <li>Is the cost of tracking this information worth the benefit?</li>
</ul>
<p>The essential attributes to track are <b> Risk, Benefit, Effort, Stability </b>and<b> Architectural Impact</b>, in order to permit prioritizing
requirements for scope management and to assign requirements to iterations.
These should be tracked initially on Features, and later on all Use Cases and
Supplemental Requirements.</p>
<h4>Consider Derived Information</h4>
<p>In addition to directly using requirements attributes, you may wish to derive
information from these requirements attributes via traceability to other
requirements types.&nbsp; Some typical patterns of derivation are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Deriving Downwards</b> - Given the traceability above, suppose a
    Product Feature has an attribute &quot;Target Release&quot;.&nbsp; One can
    derive that each Use Case Section traced to by this Product Feature must
    also be available at or before the specified Target Release.</li>
  <li><b>Deriving Upwards</b> - Given the traceability above, suppose a Use Case
    Section has an attribute &quot;Estimated Effort&quot;.&nbsp; The cost of a
    Product Feature can be estimated by summing the Estimated Effort for the Use
    Case Sections that it traces to.&nbsp; This must be used with caution, as
    several Product Features could map to the same Use Case Section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, in order to assign requirements attributes to requirements types, you
should consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What derived information / reports do we wish to generate from this
    attribute?</li>
  <li>At what level in the traceability hierarchy should we track this
    attribute?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dependency of Attributes</h4>
<p>Some attributes may only be applicable to a certain level of
development.&nbsp; For example, an estimated effort attribute for a use case may
be replaced by effort estimates on the design elements once the use case is
fully represented in the design.</p>

<p>The following are examples of requirement-related reports and measures.&nbsp;
By selecting the required/desired
set of reports and measures for your project, you can derive the necessary attributes for the
Requirements Management Plan.</p>

<h3><a name="Requirements Change Management">Requirements Change Management</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Change is inevitable, and should be planned for.&nbsp; Changes occur because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There was a change to the problem to be solved.&nbsp; This may be because
    of new regulations, economic pressures, technology changes, etc.</li>
  <li>The stakeholders changed their minds or perceptions of what they wanted
    the system to do.&nbsp; This may be due to a variety of causes, including
    changes in responsible staff, a deeper understanding of the issues, etc.</li>
  <li>Failure to include all stakeholders, or to ask all the right questions,
    when defining the original requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies to managing changing requirements include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Baseline the Requirements</li>
  <li>Establish a Single Channel to Control Change</li>
  <li>Maintain a Change History</li>
</ul>
<h4>Baseline the Requirements<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Toward the end of the elaboration phase, the System Analyst should baseline
all known requirements.&nbsp; This typically is performed by ensuring there is
version control on the requirements artifacts, and identifying the set of
artifacts and their versions that form the baseline.</p>
<p>The purpose of the baseline is not to freeze the requirements.&nbsp; Rather
it is to enable new and modified requirements to be identified, communicated,
estimated, and controlled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also see <a href="../../toolment/reqpro/tm_rbase.htm">Tool Mentor: Baselining
a Rational RequisitePro Project</a>.</p>
<h4>Establish a Single Channel to Control Change<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A stakeholder's wish for a change cannot be assumed to officially change the
budget and schedule.&nbsp; Typically a negotiation or budget reconciliation
process must be initiated before a change can be approved.&nbsp; Often changes
must be balanced against one another.</p>
<p>It is crucial that every change go through a single channel, the Change
Control Board (CCB), to determine its impact on the system and to undergo
official approval.
See <a href="../activity/ac_epcmp.htm">Activity: Establish Change
Control Process</a>. The mechanism for proposing a change is to <a href="../activity/ac_subcr.htm">submit</a>
a <a href="../artifact/ar_crqst.htm">Change Request</a>, which is <a href="../activity/ac_revcr.htm">reviewed</a>
by the CCB.</p>
<h4>Maintain a Change History<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>It is beneficial to maintain an audit trail of changes to individual
requirements.&nbsp; This change history allows you to view all prior changes to
the requirement as well as changes to attribute values, and the rationale for
the change.&nbsp; This can be useful in assessing actual stability of
requirements, and identifying cases where the change control process may not be
working (e.g. identifying requirements changes that were not properly reviewed
and approved).</p>
