<h2><a name="ActivityDiagrams">Activity Diagrams </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>

<p>The activity diagram notation is further explained in <a href="md_bactd.htm">Guidelines:
Activity Diagram in the Business Use Case Model</a>. This page exemplifies how
the notation is applied to describe a business use case realization.</p>
<p>An activity diagram of a business use case realization explores the
ordering of tasks or activities that accomplish business goals, and that satisfy
commitments between external business actors and internal business workers. An
activity may be a manual or automated task that completes a unit of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activity diagrams help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a rationale for and understanding of the introduction of information
    systems into the business.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Establish objectives for system development projects to implement business
    transformation initiatives.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Justify automation investment based on detailed business process
    metrics.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to a sequence diagram, which could be perceived as having a similar
purpose, an activity diagram with swimlanes and object flows focuses on how you
divide responsibilities into classes, whereas the sequence diagram helps you
understand how objects interact and in what sequence. Activity diagrams
focus on the workflow, while sequence diagrams focus on handling
business entities. Activity diagrams and sequence diagrams could be used as
complementary techniques, where a sequence diagram shows what happens in an
activity state.
<h3><a name="ActivityDiagramsUsingSwimlanes">Using Swimlanes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p><a name="XE_activity_diagrams__swimlanes_for_realizations"></a>If you are using swimlanes and the swimlanes are coupled to
classes (mainly business workers) in the business analysis model, you are using
the activity diagram to document business use case realizations, rather than
business use cases.</p>
<p>As an example, we show an activity diagram of the realization of the business
use case Proposal process, which you can find described <a href="md_buc.htm">Guidelines:
Business Use Case</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/md_bact8.gif" width="546" height="404"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The realization of the business use case Proposal Process</p>
<p>The activity diagram provides the details of what happens within the business
by examining people playing specific roles (the business workers) and the
activities they perform. For application-development projects, these diagrams
provide a detailed understanding of the business area that will be supported or
impacted by the new application. They help establish connection points to the
proposed new system, and these connection points give rise to system use
cases.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ActivityDiagramsUsingObjectFlows">Using Object Flows</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p><a name="XE_activity_diagrams__object_flows"></a><a name="XE_object_flows__in_activity_diagrams"></a>In
this context, object
flows are used to show how business entities are created and
used in a workflow. Object flows allow you to show inputs and outputs from
activity states in an activity graph. There are two elements to the
notation:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>object flow state</b> represents an object of a class that
    participates in the workflow the activity graph represents. The object may
    be the output of one activity and the input of many other activities.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The <b>object flow</b> is a kind of control flow with an object
    flow state as input or an output.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The object flow symbol represents the existence of an object in a particular
state, not just the object itself. The same object can be manipulated by a
number of successive activities that change the object's state. The object can
then be displayed multiple times in an activity graph, with each appearance
representing a different state during its life. The object’s state at each
point may be placed in brackets and appended to the name of the class.&nbsp;</p>

flows to show how an order changes it state while executing the
workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="md_bactd.htm">Guidelines:
Activity Diagram in the Business Use Case Model</a></p>
<p>An object flow state may appear as the target of one object flow (transition)
and the source of multiple object flows (transitions).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="picturetext">An activity diagram for the Proposal process, using object flows to show key business entities
involved</p>
<p>Object flows can be compared to data flows within the workflow of a business
use case. Unlike traditional data flows, however, object flows exist at a
definite point within an activity graph.</p>

<h2><a name="ClassDiagrams">Class Diagrams </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>

<p>Class diagrams show associations, aggregations and generalizations between
business workers and business entities. The following kinds of class diagrams
might be of interest:
<ul>
  <li>Inheritance hierarchies.</li>
  <li>Aggregates of business workers and business entities.</li>
  <li>How business workers and entities are related by means of associations.</li>
</ul>
Class diagrams show generic structures in the business domain model, but can
also be part of the documentation of a business use case realization (see <a href="md_bucr.htm">Guidelines:
Business Use Case Realization</a>) by showing it participating business workers
and business entities.&nbsp;

<h2><a name="CollaborationDiagrams">Collaboration Diagrams </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
  
<p>A collaboration diagram is semantically identical to a sequence diagram, but 
  focuses on the objects, while the latter focuses on the interactions. A collaboration 
  diagram should present the subset of objects relevant to the affected working 
  sequence, including their links, messages, and message sequences.</p>

<h2><a name="SequenceDiagrams">Sequence Diagrams </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>

<p>A sequence diagram graphically depicts the details of the interaction among
business workers, business actors, and how business entities are accessed,
during the performance of a business use case. A sequence diagram briefly
describes what the participating business workers do, and how the business
entities are manipulated, in terms of activations, and how they communicate by
sending messages to one another.</p>

<p class="picturetext">A sequence diagram of part of an Individual Check-in
business use case.</p>
<p>The same information that can be found in a sequence diagram can be presented 
  in a collaboration diagram instead.</p>

<h2><a name="StatechartDiagrams">Statechart Diagrams </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>

<p>Generally, you can use a state diagram to illustrate which states a business
worker or a business entity can have - the events that cause a transition from
one state to another; and the actions that result from a state change. A
statechart diagram often simplifies the validation of the class design.</p>
<p>For each state that an object of the class can enter, a diagram shows the
messages it can receive, the actions to be carried out, and the state the object
of the class will be in thereafter.</p>
