<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business entities represent &quot;things&quot; handled or used by the business 
  workers as they execute a business use case. A business entity often represents 
  something of value to several business use cases or use-case instances, so the 
  business entity object is rather long-lived. In general, it is good if the business 
  entity holds no information about how and by whom it is used.</p>
<p>Typically, a business entity represents a document or an essential part of a
product. Sometimes it represents something less tangible, like important
knowledge about a market or a customer. Examples of business entities at the
restaurant are Menu and Beverage; at the airport, Ticket and Boarding Pass are
important business entities.</p>
<p>You need to model as Business Entities only those phenomena to which other 
  classes in the business domain model must refer. Other &quot;things&quot; may 
  be modeled as attributes of the relevant classes or just described textually 
  in these classes.</p>
<h3><a name="Attributes">Attributes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>An <b>attribute</b> of a class represents a piece of information about an object 
  of that class that is kept with the object. An attribute has an attribute type. 
  Each attribute and attribute type, respectively, has a name.</p>
<p>An object normally holds different pieces of information that describe some 
  of its characteristics. Such pieces of information can either be described implicitly 
  in the textual description of the object’s class or modeled explicitly as an 
  attribute of the class.</p>
<p>An attribute is of a certain type. An attribute has a name, preferably a noun 
  that describes the attribute’s role in relation to the class. An attribute type 
  can be more or less primitive, starting from a simple number or string. Different 
  classes can have attributes with identical structures. Those attributes should 
  share a description; that is, they should share attribute type.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You should model attributes only to make a class more understandable!</p>

<b><a name="Using Attributes or Entities">Using Attributes or Entities</a> </b></font><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Now and then it is hard to know if you should describe a concept as an attribute 
  of a class or as a separate business entity class. The general rule is as follows: 
  Model a phenomenon as an attribute if no more than one object needs to have 
  direct access to it or if the only natural way to access it is through the object. 
  Otherwise, model the concept separately, in a class of its own.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/bent1.gif" width="111" height="71"></p>
<p class="picturetext">In the airport check-in use case, tickets are important.
Each ticket has a passenger name and a flight. Here, the attributes Name and
Flight are identified. The latter is more complex, consisting of airline,
destination, time of departure, and time of arrival.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/bent2.gif" width="325" height="60"></p>
<p class="picturetext">All passengers traveling on the same flight share that 
  flight. The airline is the same for several flights. A better alternative is 
  therefore to model flight and airline as classes.</p>
<p>Once you have decided if a concept is so important to the use case that it 
  must be modeled, what governs whether it should be modeled as a separate class 
  or merely as a class attribute is not its importance in real life. Instead, 
  what dictates how it is modeled is the business need for accessing it. This 
  means that some concepts are modeled differently for different businesses.</p>
<p>Consider an example: To the employees working in a traffic-planning use case 
  at an airport, flights are central. The time of departure, the airline, and 
  the destination must be defined for each flight. In this case, you might use 
  a class, Flight, and give it the attributes time of departure, airline, and 
  destination.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/bent3.gif" width="108" height="74"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Flights are essential to employees working in a traffic-planning 
  business use case at an airport. </p>
<p class="picturetext">On the other hand, the situation is different for the employees 
  of a travel agency. Although they still need time of departure, airline, and 
  destination, they have additional needs. What is most important to a travel 
  agency is finding a flight with a specific destination, in which case it is 
  appropriate to create a separate class for Destination. The classes Flight and 
  Destination must, of course, be aware of each other. A bi-directional association 
  allows this.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="images/bent4.gif" width="190" height="62"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Flight departures and destinations are equally essential
to employees working in a travel-agency use case.</p>
<p>Theoretically, everything can be modeled as a class. However, using
attributes when appropriate reduces the number of classes that must be
maintained and makes the object model easier to understand.</p>
<h3><a name="Operations">Operations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To perform a business worker's responsibilities, the person acting as the business 
  worker uses one or several tools to manipulate the business entities. You can 
  define these tools either generally or explicitly, with the help of operations 
  and messages representing the tools used and the accesses made. An operation 
  defines the tool with which a business entity is manipulated. The access is 
  initiated by a message. A tool that can be used to manipulate a business entity 
  object is represented as an <b>operation</b> of the business entity class, with 
  a <b>name</b> and, optionally, <b>parameters</b>. The access of a business entity 
  unit is shown as a <b>message</b> being sent to the business entity object.</p>
<p>For example, an operation &quot;associate baggage&quot; on the business entity 
  &quot;ticket&quot; would involve attaching baggage labels to the ticket. The 
  parameters would include the baggage labels.</p>
<p>Each operation is defined by a name, which should tell its purpose, and, optionally, 
  a number of parameters. The parameters specify what an object of the class should 
  expect to receive from an object that is requesting support or making an access, 
  as well as what the object will provide when the operation has been performed. 
  As an example, you can give parameters that reflect when a business worker should 
  take a step in the worker operation, or when that business worker should access 
  a certain business entity by initiating one of the business entity’s operations. 
  Parameters can also represent more or less tangible things that are handed over.</p>
<p>Operations can be defined informally or in more detail, depending on the importance 
  or required level of detail in a use case. A &quot;more detailed&quot; description 
  might describe a behavior sequence that tells which attributes and relationships 
  are dealt with during its performance, how objects of other classes are contacted, 
  and how it is terminated.</p>
<h3><a name="Characteristics of Good Business Entities">Characteristics of a
Good Business Entity</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Its name and description are clear and understandable.</li>
  <li>Business entity relationships do not depend on each other.</li>
  <li>Each relationship is used in the workflow of at least one business use
    case.</li>
  <li>All &quot;things&quot; in the business, such as products, documents,
    contracts, and so on, are modeled as business entities.</li>
  <li>It participates in at least one business use case.</li>
  <li>It has an owner; that is, a business worker or business actor responsible 
    for the business entity.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Business Events">Business Events</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business events can be used to notify interested parties (including other
business entities) of a change in state
of the business entity. The creation and destruction of a business entity may be
significant. If you have defined a state machine, examine the states of the
business entity. Each transition is a potential business event. Also inspect
the attributes and operations of the business entity. Significant operations
that are used infrequently may have a business event associated with them.
Changes to important attributes may trigger an event. Business process patterns
and business entity patterns may also provide insight into useful business
events. For example, if a business entity must be approved before being used
further, a <i>&lt;something&gt; Approved</i> business event may be useful to notify other parties
that the business event is ready for use. For more information on finding
business events, see <a href="md_bevnt.htm">Guidelines: Business Event</a>.</p>
