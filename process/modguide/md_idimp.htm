<p>The following decisions should be made regarding the Implementation
discipline's workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the <a href="../workflow/implemen/wfd_imp.htm">Implementation: 
    Workflow</a>. Study the diagram with its <a href="../glossary.htm#guard_condition"><i>guard 
    conditions</i></a> and the guidelines below. Decide which workflow details 
    to perform and in which order.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Decide what parts of the Implementation workflow details to perform. The
    following are some parts that can be introduced relatively independently
    from each other.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Decide when, during the project lifecycle, to introduce each part of the
    workflow. You can often wait until the Elaboration phase before introducing
    the whole Implementation discipline.&nbsp;Any prototyping that occurs in the
    Inception phase is usually exploratory and is not conducted with the same
    rigor (with respect to artifacts and reviews, for example) as required by
    the complete Implementation workflow during elaboration and construction.</li>

<p>Decide which artifacts to use and how to use each of them. The table below

detailed information on how to tailor each artifact, and a discussion of the
advantages and disadvantages of that specific artifact, read the section titled
&quot;Tailoring&quot; for each artifact.</p>
<p>For each artifact, decide how the artifact should be used: Must have, Should 
  have, Could have or Won't have.

<h3><a name="Decide Unit Test Coverage">Decide Unit Test Coverage</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Decide the extent to which unit testing will be performed and the level of
code coverage, which has a&nbsp; scale that goes from informal to 100% code
coverage.</p>
<p>The level of unit test coverage is often driven by the needs of the
integration and system testers, to whom the code was handed over. The system
testers are dependent on the quality of the code for their work. If the code has
too many defects, the integration and system testers will send the code back to
the implementers too often. This is a sign of a poor development process and the
solution may be to require the implementers to do more thorough unit testing.</p>
<p>Of course, you cannot expect the unit-tested code to be completely free of
defects. You do, however, need to find a &quot;healthy&quot; balance between
unit testing and quality.</p>
<p>The level of unit test coverage can also differ between different phases.
Even a safety-critical project that requires 100% code coverage during
construction and transition does not usually require that during elaboration
because many classes are only partially implemented at that stage.</p>
<h3><a name="Decide How to Review Code">Decide How to Review Code</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Decide to what extent the code should be reviewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advantages of code reviews are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To enforce and encourage a common coding style on the project. Code
    reviewing is an efficient way to make the members of the project follow the
    Programming Guidelines. To ensure this, it's more important to review
    results from all authors and Implementers than to review all source code
    files.</li>
  <li>To find errors that automated tests do not find. Code reviews catch errors
    not encountered in testing.</li>
  <li>To share knowledge between individuals and to transfer knowledge from the
    more experienced individuals to the less experienced individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of code reviews are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It takes time and resources.</li>
  <li>If not done properly, it may be inefficient. There is a danger that code
    reviewing is done &quot;just because we have to&quot; and is not done as an efficient
    complement to automated testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about code reviewing, also see <a href="../activity/ac_rvcod.htm">Activity:
Review Code</a>.</p>
<p>Code reviewing adds significant value to the project. All projects that start
to measure the levels of bugs and maintenance problems related to code reviews
claim they gain performance from the reviews. However, in many organizations
it's difficult to make them &quot;take off&quot; for several reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Not enough data is collected to verify if code reviewing actually works.</li>
  <li>Too much data is collected.</li>
  <li>Implementers are very protective about their code.</li>
  <li>The reviews get bogged down in formalities.</li>
  <li>Administrating reviews takes too much effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the following in mind to make the best possible use of code reviews:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect only adequate data.</li>
  <li>Measure the performance of the reviews&#151;and display the result.</li>
  <li>Use reviews in a &quot;lean&quot; way.</li>
</ul>
