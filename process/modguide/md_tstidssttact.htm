<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>This guideline shows how to identify <a href="../workflow/test/co_tstidslst.htm#TestIdeas">test 
  ideas</a> from statecharts and other design structures that consist mainly of 
  nodes connected by arcs and that show something of the possible control flows 
  of a program. The main goal of this testing is to traverse every arc in some 
  test. If you've never exercised an arc, why do you think it will work when a 
  customer does?</p>


<h3><a name="Implementation">Testing the Implementation</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Consider this statechart:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../workflow/test/images/tstfrsdsg-img3.gif" width="567" height="253"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig1: HVAC Statechart</p>

<p>Here's a first list of test ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Idle state receives Too Hot event</li>
  <li>Idle state receives Too Cool event</li>
  <li>Cooling/Startup state receives Compressor Running event</li>
  <li>Cooling/Ready state receives Fan Running event</li>
  <li>Cooling/Running state receives OK event</li>
  <li>Cooling/Running state receives Failure event</li>
  <li>Failure state receives Failure Cleared event</li>
  <li>Heating state receives OK event</li>
  <li>Heating state receives Failure event</li>
</ul>

<p>These test ideas could all be exercised in a single test, or you could create 
  several tests that each exercise a few. As with all test design, strive for 
  a balance between the ease of implementation of many simple tests and the additional 
  defect-finding power of complex tests. (See <a href="../workflow/test/co_tstidslst.htm#TestDesignUsingTheList">"test 
  design using the list"</a> in the <a href="../workflow/test/co_tstidslst.htm">Concept: 
  Test Ideas List</a> page.) If you have use case scenarios that describe certain 
  paths through the statechart, you should favor tests that take those paths.</p>

<p>In any case, the tests should check that all actions required by the statechart 
  actually take place. For example, is the alarm started on entry to the Failure 
  state, then stopped upon exit?</p>

<p>The test should also check that the transition leads to the correct next state. 
  That can be a difficult problem when the states are invisible from the outside. 
  The only way to detect an incorrect state is to inject some sequence of events 
  that leads to incorrect output. More precisely, you would need to construct 
  a follow-on sequence of events whose externally-visible results for the <i>correct</i> 
  state differ from those that the same sequence would provoke from each possible 
  <i>incorrect</i> state.</p>

<p>In the example above, how would you know that the Failure Cleared event in 
  the Failure state correctly led to the Idle state, instead of staying in the 
  Failure state? You might trust that the stopping of the Alarm meant that transition 
  had been made, but it might be better to check by lowering the temperature enough 
  to make the heater start or raising it enough to turn on cooling. If something 
  happens, you're more confident that the transition was correct. If nothing happens, 
  it's likely the device stayed in the Failure state.</p>

<p>At the very least, determining whether the resulting state is correct complicates 
  test design. It is often better to make the state machine explicit and make 
  its states visible to the tests.</p>

<h4>Other statechart constructs<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Statecharts consist of more than arcs and arrows. Here is a list of statechart 
  constructs and the effect they have on the test idea list.</p>

<h5>Event actions, entry actions, and exit actions<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>These do not generate test ideas per se. Rather, the tests should check that 
  the actions behave as specified. If the actions represent substantial programs, 
  those programs must be tested. The test ideas for the programs might be combined 
  with test ideas from the statechart, but it's probably more manageable to separate 
  them. Make the decision based on the effort involved and on your suspicion that 
  there might be interactions between events. That is, if a particular action 
  on one arc cannot possibly share data with an action on another arc, there is 
  no reason to exercise the two actions in the same test (as you would if they 
  were part of the same path through a statechart test).</p>

<h5>Guard conditions<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>Guard conditions are boolean expressions. The test ideas for guard conditions 
  are derived as described in <a href="../modguide/md_tstidsblnbnd.htm">Guideline: 
  Test Ideas for Booleans and Boundaries</a>. </p>

<p>In the example above, the Too Cool transition from the Idle state is guarded 
  with [restart time &gt;= 5 mins]. That leads to two separate test ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Idle state receives Too Cool event when restart time is
        five minutes (transition taken)</li>
    <li>Idle state receives Too Cool event when restart time is
        just less than five minutes (transition blocked)</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, any test that uses the test idea should check that the correct 
  state is reached.</p>

<h5>Internal transitions<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>An internal transition adds the same sort of ideas to a test idea list as an 
  external transition does. It's merely that the next state is the same as the 
  original state. It would be prudent to set up the test such that the state's 
  entry and exit actions would cause an observable effect if they were incorrectly 
  triggered.</p>

<h5>Nested states<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>When constructing tests, set them up such that entry and exit events of the 
  composite state have observable effects. You want to notice if they're skipped.</p>

<h5>Concurrent substates<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>Testing of concurrency falls outside of the scope of developer testing.</p>

<h5>Deferred events<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>If you suspect an event might be handled differently depending on whether it 
  was deferred and queued rather than generated while the program was actually 
  in the receiving state, you might test those two cases.</p>
<p>If the event in the receiving state has a guard condition, consider the ramifications 
  of changes to the condition's variables between the time the event is generated 
  and the time it is received. </p>
<p>If more than one state can handle a deferred event, consider testing deferral 
  to each of the possible receiving states. Perhaps the implementation assumes 
  that the &quot;obvious&quot; state will handle the event.</p>

<h5>History states<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>Here is an example of a history state:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/md_state3.gif" width="412" height="211"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig2: History State Example</p>

<p>The transition into the history state represents three real transitions, and 
  thus three test ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>BackupUp event in Command state leads to Collecting state</li>
    <li>BackupUp event in Command state leads to Copying state</li>
    <li>BackupUp event in Command state leads to CleaningUp state</li>
</ul>

<h5>Chain states<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="18" height="14"></a></h5>
<p>Chain states do not seem to have any implications for test design, except that 
  they introduce more actions that need to be checked.</p>

<h3><a name="Design">Testing the Design</a> 
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>The preceding discussion focuses on checking whether the implementation matches 
  the design. But the design might also be wrong. While examining the design to 
  find test ideas, also check for two types of problems:</p>

<p><b>Missing events.</b> The statechart shows a state's response to events <i>that 
  the designer anticipated could arrive in that state</i>. It's not unknown for 
  designers to overlook events. For example, in this statechart (repeated from 
  the top of the page), perhaps the designer forgot that a failure can occur in 
  the Ready substate of Cooling, not just when the fan is Running.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../workflow/test/images/tstfrsdsg-img3.gif" width="567" height="253"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig3: HVAC Statechart</p>

<p>For this reason, it's wise to ask, for each state, whether any of the events 
  that apply to other states might apply to this one. If you discover that one 
  does, correct your design.</p>

<p><b>Incomplete or missing guard conditions.</b> Similarly, perhaps guard conditions 
  on one transition will suggest guard conditions on others. For example, the 
  above statechart takes care not to restart the heater too often, but there is 
  no such restriction on the cooling system. Should there be? </p>
<p>It is also possible that variables used on one guard condition will suggest 
  that other guard conditions are too simple.</p>

<h3><a name="Interactions">Testing Interactions</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Testing each arc in a graph is by no means complete testing. For example, suppose 
  the start state initializes a variable to 0, state Setter sets it to 5, and 
  state Divider divides it into 100 (100/variable). If there's a path from the 
  start state to Divider that does not pass through Setter, you have a divide-by-zero 
  exception. If the statechart has many states, simply exercising each arc might 
  miss that path.</p>
<p>Except for very simple statecharts, testing every path is infeasible. In practice, 
  tests that are complex and correspond to use case scenarios are often sufficient. 
  If you desire stronger tests, consider requiring a path from each state where 
  a datum is given a value to each state that uses it.</p>
