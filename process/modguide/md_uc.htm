<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There are several key words in this definition:
<ul>
  <li><b>Use-case instance</b><i>.</i> The sequence referred to in the
    definition is really a specific flow of events through the system, or an
    instance. Many flows of events are possible, and many may be very similar.
    To make a use-case model understandable, you should group similar flows of
    events into one use case. Identifying and describing a use case really means
    identifying and describing a group of related flows of events.</li>
  <li><b>System performs</b><i>.</i> This means that the system
    provides the use case. An actor communicates with a use-case instance of the
    system.</li>
  <li><b>An observable result of value.</b> You can put a value on a
    successfully performed use case. A use case should make sure that an actor
    can perform a task that has an identifiable value. This is very important in
    determining the correct level or granularity for a use case. Correct level
    refers to achieving use cases that are not too small. In certain
    circumstances, you can use a use case as a planning unit in an organization
    that includes individuals who are actors in the system.</li>
  <li><b>Actions.</b> An action is a computational or algorithmic
    procedure. It is invoked either when the actor provides a signal to the
    system or when the system gets a time event. An action may imply signal
    transmissions to either the invoking actor or other actors. An action is
    atomic, which means it is performed either entirely or not at all.</li>
  <li><b>A particular actor</b><i>.</i> The actor is key to finding
    the correct use case, especially because the actor helps you avoid use cases
    that are too large. As an example, consider a visual modeling tool. There
    are really two actors to this application: a developer – someone who
    develops systems using the tool as support; and a system administrator –
    someone who manages the tool. Each of these actors has his own demands on
    the system, and will therefore require his own set of use cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality of a system is defined by different use cases, each of
which represents a specific flow of events. The description of a use case
defines what happens in the system when the use case is performed.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="../../manuals/intro/images/im_uc.gif" width="325" height="173"></p>
<p class="picturetext">In an automated teller machine the client can, for
instance, withdraw money from an account, transfer money to an account, or check
the balance of an account. These functions correspond to flows that you can
represent with use cases.</p>
<p>Each use case has a task of its own to perform. The collected use cases
constitute all the possible ways of using the system. You can get an idea of a
use-case task simply by observing its name.</p>
<h3><a name="How to Find Use Cases">How to Find Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Following is a set of questions that are useful when identifying use cases:
<ul>
  <li>For each actor you have identified, what are the tasks in which the system
    would be involved?</li>
  <li>Does the actor need to be informed about certain occurrences in the
    system?</li>
  <li>Will the actor need to inform the system about sudden, external changes?</li>
  <li>Does the system supply the business with the correct behavior?</li>
  <li>Can all features be performed by the use cases you have identified?</li>
  <li>What use cases will support and maintain the system?</li>
  <li>What information must be modified or created in the system?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use cases that are often overlooked, since they do not represent what
typically are the primary functions of the system, can be of the following kind:
<ul>
  <li>System start and stop.</li>
  <li>Maintenance of the system. For example, adding new users and setting up
    user profiles.</li>
  <li>Maintenance of data stored in the system. For example, the system is
    constructed to work in parallel with a legacy system, and data needs to be
    synchronized between the two.</li>
  <li>Functionality needed to modify behavior in the system. An example would be
    functionality for creating new reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have developed a business use-case model and a business analysis model,
see also <a href="md_bmtse.htm">Guidelines: Going from Business Models to
Systems</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="How a Use Case Evolves">How a Use Case Evolves</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In early iterations in elaboration, only a few use cases (those that are
considered architecturally significant) are described in any detail beyond the
brief description. You should always first develop an outline of the use case
(in step-by-step format) before delving into the details. This step-by-step
outline should be your first attempt at defining the structure of the flow of
events of the use case (see <a href="#Flow of Events - Structure">Flow of Events
- Structure</a> below). Always start with the basic flow of the use case. Once
there is some agreement on the outline of the basic flow, you can add what the
alternative flows should be in relation to the basic flow.</p>
<p>Towards the end of elaboration, all use cases you plan to describe in detail
should be completed.</p>
<h3><a name="Are All Use Cases Described in Detail?">Are All Use Cases Described
in Detail?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There will often be use cases in your model that are so simple that they do
not need a detailed description of the flow of events, a step-by-step outline is
quite enough. The criteria for making this decision is that you don't see
disagreement among user kind of readers on what the use case means, and that
designers and testers are comfortable with the level of detail provided by the
step-by-step format. Examples are use cases that describe simple entry or
retrieval of some data from the system.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_use_case__scope_of_a_use_case"></a><a name="The Scope of a Use Case">The
Scope of a Use Case</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>It is often hard to decide if a set of user-system interactions, or dialog,
is one or several use cases. Consider the use of a recycling machine. The
customer inserts deposit items, such as cans, bottles, and crates, into the
recycling machine. When she has inserted all her deposit items, she presses a
button, and a receipt is printed. She can then exchange this receipt for money.</p>
<p>Is it one use case to insert a deposit item, and another use case to require
the receipt? Or is it all one use case? There are two actions, but one without
the other is of little value to the customer. Rather, it is the complete dialog
with all the insertions, and getting the receipt, that is of value for the
customer (and makes sense to her). Thus, the complete dialog, from inserting the
first deposit item, to pressing the button and getting the receipt, is a
complete case of use, a use case.</p>
<p>Additionally, you want to keep the two actions together, to be able to review
them at the same time, modify them together, test them together, write manuals
for them and in general manage them as a unit. This becomes very obvious in
larger systems.</p>
<h3><a name="How Use Cases Are Realized">How Use Cases Are Realized</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A use case describes what happens in the system when an actor interacts with
the system to execute the use case. The use case does not define how the system
internally performs its tasks in terms of collaborating objects. This is left
for the use-case realizations to show.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">In the telephone example, the use case would indicate - among
other things - that the system issues a signal when the receiver is lifted and
that the system then receives digits, finds the receiving party, rings his
telephone, connects the call, transmits speech, and so on.</p>
<p>In an executing system, an instance of a use case does not correspond to any
particular object in the implementation model (for example, an instance of a
class in the code). Instead, it corresponds to a specific flow of events that is
invoked by an actor and executed as a sequence of events among a set of objects.
In other words, instances of use cases correspond to communicating instances of
implemented objects. We call this the realization of the use case. Often, the
same objects participate in realizations of more than one use case. For example,
both the use cases Deposit and Withdrawal in a banking system may use a certain
account object in their realization. This does not mean that the two use cases
communicate, only that they use the same object in their realization.</p>
<p>You can view a flow of events as consisting of several subflows, which taken
together yield the total flow of events. You can reuse the description of a
subflow in other use cases' flow of events. Subflows in the description of one
use case's flow of events may be common to those of other use cases. In the
design you should have the same objects perform this common behavior for all the
relevant use cases; that is, only one set of objects should perform this
behavior, no matter which use case is executing.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">In an automated teller machine system the initial subflow is
the same in the flow of events of the use cases Withdraw Money and Check
Balance. The flow of events of both use cases start by checking the identity of
the card and the client's personal access code.</p>
<h3><a name="A Use-Case has Many Possible Instances">A Use Case has Many
Possible Instances</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A use-case instance can follow an almost unlimited, but enumerable, number of
paths. These paths represent the choices open to the use-case instance in the
description of its flow of events. The path chosen depends on events. Types of
events include:
<ul>
  <li>Input from an actor. For example, an actor can decide, from several
    options, what to do next.</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">In the use case Recycle Items in the Recycling-Machine System
the Customer always has two options: hand in still another deposit item or get
the receipt of returned items.
<ul>
  <li>A check of values or types of an internal object or attribute. For
    example, the flow of events may differ if a value is greater or less than a
    certain value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">In the use case Withdraw Money in an automated teller machine
system, the flow of events will differ if the Client asks for more money than he
has in his account. Thus, the use-case instance will follow different paths.</p>
<h3><a name="Concurrency of Use Case Instances">Concurrency of Use-Case
Instances</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Instances of several use cases and several instances of the same use case
work concurrently if the system permits it. In use-case modeling, you can assume
that instances of use cases can be active concurrently without conflict. The
design model is expected to solve this problem, because use-case modeling does
not describe how things work. One way to view this is to assume that only one
use-case instance is active at a time and that executing this instance is an
atomic action. In use-case modeling, the &quot;interpreting machine&quot; is
considered infinitely fast, so that serialization of use case instances is not a
problem.</p>
<h3><a name="Name">Name</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Each use case should have a name that indicates what is achieved by its
interaction with the actor(s). The name may have to be several words to be
understood. No two use cases can have the same name.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">These are examples of variations of the name for the use case
Recycle Items in the Recycling Machine example:
<ul>
  <li>Receive Deposit Items</li>
  <li>Receiving Deposit Items</li>
  <li>Return Deposit Items</li>
  <li>Deposit Items</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Brief Description">Brief Description</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The brief description of the use case should reflect its purpose. As
you write the description, refer to the actors involved in the use case, the
glossary and, if you need to, define new concepts.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">Following are sample brief descriptions of the use cases
Recycle Items and Add New Bottle Type in the Recycling-Machine System:</p>
<p class="example"><b>Recycle Items</b>: The user uses this machine to
automatically have all the return items (bottles, cans, and crates) counted, and
receives a receipt. The receipt is to be cashed at a cash register (machine).</p>
<p class="example"><b>Add New Bottle Type</b>: New kinds of bottles
can be added to the machine by starting it in &#145;learning mode&#146; and inserting
5 samples just like when returning items. In this way, the machine can measure
the bottles and learn to identify them. The manager specifies the refund value
for the new bottle type.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_use_case__flow_of_events"></a><a name="XE_flow_of_events__guidelines_for"></a><a name="Flow of Events - Contents">Flow
of Events - Contents</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The <b>Flow of Events</b> of a use case contains the most important
information derived from use-case modeling work. It should describe the use
case's flow of events clearly enough for an outsider to easily understand it.
Remember the flow of events should present what the system does, not how the
system is design to perform the required behavior.</p>
<p>Guidelines for the contents of the flow of events are:
<ul>
  <li>Describe how the use case starts and ends.</li>
  <li>Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the use case.</li>
  <li>Do not describe the details of the user interface, unless it is necessary 
    to understand the behavior of the system. For example, it is often good to 
    use a limited set of web-specific terminology when it is known beforehand 
    that the application is going to be web-based. Otherwise, your run the risk 
    that the use-case text is being perceived as too abstract. Words to include 
    in your terminology could be &quot;navigate&quot;, &quot;browse&quot;, &quot;hyperlink&quot; 
    &quot;page&quot;, &quot;submit&quot;, and &quot;browser&quot;. However, it 
    is not advisable to include references to &quot;frames&quot; or &quot;web 
    pages&quot; in such a way that you are making assumptions about the boundaries 
    between them - this is a critical design decision.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, 
    start every action with &quot;When the actor ... &quot;.</li>
  <li>Describe only the events that belong to the use case, and not what happens 
    in other use cases or outside of the system.</li>
  <li>Avoid vague terminology such as &quot;for example&quot;, &quot;etc. &quot; 
    and &quot;information&quot;.</li>
  <li>Detail the flow of events&#151;all &quot;whats&quot; should be answered.
    Remember that test designers are to use this text to identify test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have used certain terms in other use cases, be sure to use the exact
same terms in this use case, and that their intended meaning is the same. To
manage common terms, put them in a glossary.</p>
<h3><a name="Flow of Events - Structure">Flow of Events &#151; Structure</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The two main parts of the flow of events are <b>basic flow of events</b>
and <a name="XE_flow_of_events__alternative_flow"></a><b>alternative flows
of events</b>. The basic flow of events should cover what
&quot;normally&quot; happens when the use case is performed. The alternative
flows of events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation
to the normal behavior, and also variations of the normal behavior. You can
think of the alternative flows of events as &quot;detours&quot; from the basic
flow of events, some of which will return to the basic flow of events and some
of which will end the execution of the use case.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ucstrct.gif" width="231" height="212"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The typical structure of the flow of events. The straight 
  arrow represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative 
  paths in relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic 
  flow of events; whereas others end the use case.</p>
<p>Both the basic flow of events and the alternative flows events should be
further structured into steps or subflows. In doing this, your main goal should
be readability of the text (see also the section <a href="#Flow of Events - Style">Flow
of Events &#151; Style</a> below). A rule of thumb is that a subflow should be a
segment of behavior within the use case that has a clear purpose, and is
&quot;atomic&quot; in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions
described. You may need to have several levels of subflows, but if you can you
should avoid it since it makes the text more complex and harder to understand.
You can illustrate the structure of the flow of events with and activity
diagram, see <a href="md_actd.htm">Guidelines: Activity Diagram in the Use Case</a>.</p>
<p>This type of written text, structured into consecutive subsections, will by
its nature imply to the reader that there is a sequence between the subflows. To
avoid misunderstandings, you should always point out whether the order of the
subflows is fixed or not. Considerations of this kind are often related to:
<ul>
  <li>Business rules. For example, the user has to be authorized before the
    system can make certain data available.</li>
  <li>User-interface design. For example, the system should not enforce a
    certain sequence of behavior that may be intuitive to some but not to other
    users.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify where an alternative flow of events fits in the structure, you
need to describe the following for each &quot;detour&quot; to the basic flow of
events:
<ul>
  <li>Where in the basic flow of events the alternative behavior can be
    inserted.</li>
  <li>The condition that needs to be fulfilled for the alternative behavior to
    start.</li>
  <li>How and where the basic flow of events is resumed, or how the use case
    ends.</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">This is an alternative subflow in the use case Return Items
in the Recycling-Machine System.</p>
<p class="example"><b>2.1. Bottle Stuck</b></p>
<p class="example">If in section 1.5, Insert Deposit Items, a bottle gets stuck
in the gate, the sensors around the gate and the measuring gate will detect this
problem. The conveyer belt is stopped and the machine issues an alarm to call
for the operator. The machine will wait for the operator to indicate that the
problem has been fixed. The machine then continues in section 1.9 of the basic
flow.</p>
<p>In the example above, the alternative flow of events is inserted at a
specific location in the basic flow of events. There are also alternative flow
of events that can be inserted at more than one location, some can even be
inserted at any location in the basic flow of events.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">This is an alternative subflow in the use case Return Items
in the Recycling-Machine System.</p>
<p class="example"><b>2.2. Front Panel is Removed</b></p>
<p class="example">If somebody removes the front panel to the Recycling machine,
the can compression is deactivated. It will not be possible to start the can
compression with the front panel off. The removal will also activate an alarm to
the operator. When the front panel is closed again, the machine resumes
operation from the location in the basic flow of events at which it was stopped.</p>
<p>It might be tempting, if the alternative flow of events is very simple, to
just describe it in the basic flow of events section (using some informal
&quot;if-then-else&quot; construct). This should be avoided. Too many
alternatives will make the normal behavior difficult to see. Also, including
alternative paths in the basic flow of events section will make the text more
&quot;pseudo-code like&quot; and harder to read.</p>
<p>In general, extracting parts of the flow of events and describing these parts
separately, can increase the readability of the basic flow of events and improve
the structure of the use case and the use-case model. You can model extracted
parts as:
<ul>
  <li>An alternative flow of events within the base use case if it is a simple
    variant, option, or exception to the basic flow of events.</li>
  <li>As an explicit inclusion in the base use case (see <a href="md_incl.htm">Guidelines:
    Include-Relationship</a>) if it is something that you wish to encapsulate so
    that it can be reused by other use cases.</li>
  <li>As an implicit inclusion in the base use case (see <a href="md_exrel.htm">Guidelines:
    Extend-Relationship</a>), if the basic flow of events of the base use case
    is complete, that is, has a defined beginning and end. The nature of the
    extending flow should be such that you prefer to conceal it in the
    description of the base use case to render it less complex.</li>
  <li>A subflow in the basic flow of events, possibly as another option, if none
    of the above alternatives applies. For example, in a Maintain Employee
    Information use case, there may be separate subflows for adding, deleting
    and modifying employee information.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Flow of Events - Style">Flow of Events &#151; Style</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You can describe use cases in many styles. As an example we show the basic
flow of events of the use case Administer Order described in three different
styles, varying primarily in how formal they are. The first style, shown in <a href="#Example 1:">example
1</a> below, is recommended, because it is easy to understand, and the order in
which things happen is clearly evident. The text is divided into numbered and
named subsections. Numbers are there to make it easy to refer to a subsection.
Names of subsections will let the reader get a quick overview of the flow of
events by browsing through the text reading only the headers.</p>
<p>In <a href="#Example 2:">example 2</a> below, the description of the flow of
events fails to clarify the order in which things happen. If you write in this
style, you and others might miss important things that concern the system.</p>
<p><a href="#Example 3:">Example 3</a> below shows a yet another style, which
can be useful if you find it difficult to express the sequence of events
clearly. This pseudo-code style is more precise, but the text is hard to read
and absorb for a non-technical person, especially if you want to grasp the flow
of events quickly.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><b>1.1. Start of Use Case</b>
    <p>This use case starts when the actor Operator tells the system to create a
    measurement order. The system will then retrieve all Network Element actors,
    their measurement objects and corresponding measurement functions that are
    available to this particular Operator. Available Network Elements are those
    that are in operation, and that the Operator has the authority to access.
    The availability of measurement functions depends on what has been set up
    for a particular type of measurement object.</p>
    <p><b>1.2. Configure Measurement Order</b></p>
    <p>The system allows the actor Operator to select which Network Elements to
    measure and then shows which measurement objects are available for the
    selected Network Elements. The system allows the Operator to select from the
    measurement objects, and then select which measurement functions to set up
    for each measurement object.</p>
    <p>The system allows the Operator to enter a textual comment on the
    measurement order.</p>
    <p>The Operator tells the system to complete the measurement order. The
    system will respond by generating a unique name for the measurement order
    and setting up default values for when, how often, and for how long the
    measurement should be made. The default values are unique to each Operator.
    The system then allows the Operator to edit these default values.</p>
    <p><b>1.3. Initialize Order</b></p>
    <p>The Operator tells the system to initialize the measurement order. The

<h3><a name="XE_flow_of_events__examples_of"></a><a name="Flow of Events - Example">Flow
of Events &#151; Example</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The complete description of the flow of events of the use case Administer
Order, including its alternative flows, could look as follows:</p>
<p><b>1. Basic Flow of Events</b></p>
<p><b>1.1. Start of Use Case</b></p>
<p>This use case starts when the actor Operator tells the system to create a
measurement order. The system will then retrieve all Network Element actors,
their measurement objects and corresponding measurement functions that are
available to this particular Operator. Available Network Elements are those that
are in operation, and that the Operator has the authority to access. The
availability of measurement functions depends on what has been set up for a
particular type of measurement object.</p>
<p><b>1.2. Configure Measurement Order</b></p>
<p>The system allows the actor Operator to select which Network Elements to
measure and then shows which measurement objects are available for the selected
Network Elements. The system allows the Operator to select from these
measurement objects, and then select which measurement functions to set up for
each measurement object.</p>
<p>The system allows the Operator to enter a textual comment on the measurement
order.</p>
<p>The Operator tells the system to complete the measurement order. The system
will respond by generating a unique name for the measurement order and setting
up default values for when, how often, and for how long the measurement should
be made. The default values are unique to each Operator. The system then allows
the Operator to edit these default values.</p>
<p><b>1.3. Initialize Order</b></p>
<p>The Operator tells the system to initialize the measurement order. The system
will then record the identity of the creating Operator, the date of creation,
and the &quot;Scheduled&quot; status of the measurement order.</p>
<p><b>1.4. Use Case Ends</b></p>
<p>The system confirms initialization of the measurement order to the Operator,
and the measurement order is made available for other actors to view.</p>
<p><b>2. Alternative Flows of Events</b></p>
<p><b>2.1. No Network Elements Available</b></p>
<p>If in 1.1, Start of Use Case, it turns out that no Network Elements are
available to measure for this Operator, the system will inform the Operator. The
use case then ends.</p>
<p><b>2.2. No Measurement Functions Available</b></p>
<p>If in 1.2, Configure Measurement Order, no measurement functions are
available for the selected Network Elements, the system will inform the Operator
and allow the Operator to select other Network elements.</p>
<p><b>2.3. Cancel Measurement Order</b></p>
<p>The system will allow the Operator to cancel all actions at any point during
the execution of the use case. The system will then return to the state it was
in before the use case was started, and end the use case.</p>
<h3><a name="Special Requirements">Special Requirements</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements
on the use case that are not covered by the flow of events. These are
non-functional requirements that will influence the design model. See also the
discussion on non-functional requirements in <a href="md_ucmod.htm">Guidelines:
Use-Case Model</a>. You could organize these requirements in categories such as
Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Substitutability, but normally there
are so few of them that such grouping is not particularly value-adding.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">In the Recycling-Machine System, a special requirement of the
Return Deposit Items use case could be:</p>
<p class="example">The machine has to be able to recognize deposit items with a
reliability of more than 95 percent.</p>
      <h3><a name="XE_postcondition__guidelines_for"></a><a name="XE_precondition__guidelines_for"></a><a name="preconditions and Postconditions">Preconditions 
        and Postconditions</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>It can be useful to use the notion of <b>precondition</b> and <b>postcondition</b>
to clarify how the flow of events starts and ends. However, only use it if it is
perceived as adding value by the audience of the use case.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ucprepst.gif" width="344" height="278"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A precondition is the state of the system and its
surroundings that is required before the use case can be started. A
postcondition is the states the system can be in after the use case has ended.</p>
<p>Consider the following:
<ul>
  <li>The states described by pre- or postconditions should be states that the
    user can observe. &quot;The user has logged on to the system&quot; or
    &quot;The user has opened the document&quot; are examples of observable
    states.</li>
  <li>A precondition is a constraint on when a use case can start. It is not
    the event that starts the use case.</li>
  <li>A precondition for a use case is not a precondition for only one subflow,
    although you can define preconditions and postconditions at the subflow level.</li>
  <li>A postcondition for a use case should be true regardless of which
    alternative flows were executed; it should not be true only for the main
    flow. If something could fail, you would cover that in the postcondition by
    saying &quot;The action is completed, or if something failed, the action is
    not performed&quot;, rather than just &quot;The action is completed&quot;.</li>
  <li>When you use postconditions together with extend-relationships, you
    should take care that the extending use case does not introduce a subflow
    that violates the postcondition in the base use case.</li>
  <li>Postconditions can be a powerful tool for describing use cases. You first 
    define what the use case is supposed to achieve &#151; the postcondition. 
    You can then describe how to reach this condition &#151; the flow of events needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">A precondition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM
machine: The customer has a personally-issued card that fits in the card reader,
has been issued a PIN number, and is registered with the banking system.</p>
<p class="example">A postcondition for the use case Cash Withdrawal in the ATM
machine: At the end of the use case, all account and transaction logs are
balanced, communication with the banking system is reinitialized and the
customer has been returned his card.</p>
<h3><a name="Extension Points">Extension Points</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>An <b>extension point</b> opens up the use case to the possibility
of an extension. It has a name, and a list of references to one or more
locations within the flow of events of the use case. An extension point may
reference a single location between two behavior steps within the use case. It
may also reference a set of discrete locations.</p>
<p>To use named extension points will help you separate the specification of the
behavior of the extending use case from the internal details of the base use
case. The base use case can be modified or rearranged, as long as the names of
the extension points remain the same it will not affect the extending use case.
At the same time, you are not loading down the text describing the flow of
events of the base use case with details of where behavior might be extended
into it. See also <a href="md_exrel.htm">Guidelines: Extend-Relationship</a>.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example:</p>
<p class="example">In a phone system, the use case Place Call can be extended by
the <a name="XE_use_case__abstract_use_case" href="md_ucmod.htm#Concrete and Abstract Use Cases">abstract
</a>use case Show Caller Identity. This is an optional service, often referred
to as &quot;Caller ID&quot;, that may or may not have been requested by the
receiving party. A description of the extension point in the use case Place Call
could look as follows:</p>
<p class="example"><b>Name</b>: Show Identity</p>
<p class="example"><b>Location</b>: After section 1.9 Ring Receiving
Party's Phone.</p>
<h3><a name="Use-Case Diagrams">Use-Case Diagrams</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You may choose to illustrate how a use case relates to actors and other use 
  cases in a use-case diagram (in unusual cases, more than one diagram), owned 
  by the use case. This is useful if the use case is involved with many actors, 
  or has relationships to many other use cases. A diagram of this kind is of &quot;local&quot; 
  character, since it shows the use-case model from the perspective of one use 
  case only and is not intended to explain any general facts about the whole use-case 
  model. See also <a href="md_ucdgr.htm">Guidelines: Use-Case Diagram</a>.</p>
