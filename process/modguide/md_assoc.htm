<p><a name="XE_boundary_class__associations,_general_guidelines"></a>Associations
represent structural relationships between objects of different classes; they
represent connections between instances of two or more classes that exist for some duration.
Contrast this with transient links that, for example, exist only for the
duration of an operation. These latter situations can instead be modeled using
collaborations, in which the links exist only in particular limited contexts.</p>
<p><a name="XE_association__recommendations_for_using"></a>You can use
associations to show that objects know about another objects. Sometimes, objects
must hold references to each other to be able to interact, for example send
messages to each other; thus, in some cases associations may follow from
interaction patterns in sequence diagrams or collaboration diagrams.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_association__naming"></a><a name="Names">Association Names </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Most associations are binary (exist between exactly two classes), and are
drawn as solid paths connecting pairs of class symbols. An association may have
either a name or the association <a href="#Roles">roles</a> may have names. Role
names are preferable, as they convey more information. In cases where only one
of the roles can be named, roles are still preferable to association names so
long as the association is expected to be uni-directional, starting from the
object to which the role name is associated.</p>
<p>Associations are most often named during analysis, before sufficient
information exists to properly name the roles. Where used, association names
should reflect the purpose of the relationship and be a verb phrase. The name of
the association is placed on, or adjacent to the association path.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In an ATM, the <b>Cash Drawer</b> provides the
money that the <b>Cash Dispenser </b>dispenses. In order for the <b>Cash
Dispenser </b>to be able to dispense funds, it must keep a reference to the
<b>Cash Drawer</b> object; similarly, if the <b>Cash Drawer </b>runs
out of funds, the <b>Cash Dispenser</b> object must be notified, so
the <b>Cash Drawer</b> must keep a reference to the <b>Cash
Dispenser.</b> An association models this reference.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/assoc0.gif" alt="an example association name" width="415" height="93"></p>
<p class="picturetext">An association between the <b>Cash Dispenser</b>
and the <b>Cash Drawer</b>, named <b>supplies Value</b>.</p>
<p>Association names, if poorly chosen, can be confusing and misleading. The
following example illustrates good and bad naming. In the first diagram,
association names are used, and while they are syntactically correct (using verb
phrases), they do not convey much information about the relationship. In the
second diagram, role names are used, and these convey much more about the nature
of the participation in the association.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/md_asso3.gif" width="401" height="471"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Examples of good and bad usage of association and role
names</p>
<h3><a name="XE_roles_on_associations__guidelines_for"></a><a name="Roles">Roles</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Each end of an association is a <b>role</b> specifying the face
that a class plays in the association<b>. </b>Each role must have a
name, and the role names opposite a class must be unique. The role name should
be a noun indicating the associated object's role in relation to the associating
object. A suitable role name for a <b>Teacher</b> in an association
with a <b>Course Section</b> would, for instance, be <b>lecturer</b>;
avoid names like &quot;<b>has</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>contains</b>&quot;,
as they add no information about what the relationships are between the classes.</p>
<p>Note that the use of association names and role names is mutually exclusive:
one would not use both an association name <b>and</b> a role name.
Role names are preferable to association names except in cases where
insufficient information exists to name the role appropriately (as is often the
case in analysis; in design role names should always be used). Lack of a good
role name suggests an incomplete or ill-formed model.</p>
<p>The role name is placed next to the end of the association line.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">Consider the relationships between classes in an order entry
system. A Customer can have two different kinds of Addresses: an address to
which bills are sent, and a number of addresses to which orders may be sent. As
a result, we have <b>two</b> associations between Customer and
Address, as shown below. The associations are labeled with the <b>role</b>
the associated address plays for the Customer.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/assoc1.gif" alt="examples of associations" width="349" height="342"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Associations between <b>Customer</b>, <b>Address</b>,
and <b>Order, </b>showing both role names and multiplicities</p>
<h3><a name="XE_multiplicity_for_associations__guidelines_for"></a><a name="XE_association__multiplicity"></a><a name="Multiplicity">Multiplicity</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>For each role you can specify the <b>multiplicity </b>of its class,
how many objects of the class can be associated with one object of the other
class. Multiplicity is indicated by a text expression on the role. The
expression is a comma-separated list of integer ranges. A range is indicated by
an integer (the lower value), two dots, and an integer (the upper value); a
single integer is a valid range, and the symbol '*' indicates &quot;many&quot;,
that is, an unlimited number of objects. The symbol '*' by itself is equivalent
to '0..*', that is, any number including none; this is the default value. An
optional scalar role has the multiplicity 0..1.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the previous example, multiplicities were shown for the
associations between Order and Customer, and between Customer and Address.
Interpreting the diagram, it says that an Order must have an associated Customer
(the multiplicity is 1..1 at the Customer end), but a Customer may not have any
Orders (the multiplicity is 0..* at the Order end). Furthermore, a Customer has
one billing address, but has one or more shipping address. To reduce notational
clutter, if multiplicities are omitted, they may be assumed to be 1..1.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_roles_on_associations__navigability_property"></a><a name="XE_navigability_on_associations__guidelines_for"></a><a name="XE_association__navigability"></a><a name="Navigability">Navigability</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The <b>navigability </b>property on a role indicates that it is
possible to navigate from a associating class to the target class using the
association. This may be implemented in a number of ways: by direct object
references, by associative arrays, hash-tables, or any other implementation
technique that allows one object to reference another. Navigability is indicated
by an open arrow, which is placed on the target end of the association line next
to the target class (the one being navigated to). The default value of the
navigability property is <b>true</b>.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the order entry example, the association between the <b>Order</b>
and the <b>Customer</b> is navigable in <b>both</b>
directions: an <b>Order</b> must know which <b>Customer </b>placed
the <b>Order</b>, and the <b>Customer</b> must know which <b>Orders</b>
it has placed. When no arrowheads are shown, the association is assumed to be
navigable in both directions.</p>
<p class="example">In the case of the associations between <b>Customer </b>and
<b>Address, </b>the <b>Customer</b> must know its <b>Addresses</b>,
but the <b>Addresses </b>have no knowledge of which <b>Customers</b>
(or other classes, since many things have addresses) are associated with the
address. As a result, the navigability property of the <b>Customer</b>
end of the association is turned off, resulting in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/assoc2.gif" alt="examples of navigability on associations" width="337" height="298"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Updated Order Entry System classes, showing navigability
of associations.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_association__self-associations"></a><a name="Self-Associations">Self-Associations</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, a class has an association to itself. This does not necessarily
mean that an instance of that class has an association to itself; more often, it
means that one instance if the class has associations to other instances of the
same class. In the case of self-associations, role names are essential to
distinguish the purpose for the association.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">Consider the following self-association involving the class <b>Employee</b>:</p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext"><img src="images/assoc4.gif" alt="example of a self-association" width="170" height="123"></p>
<p class="example">In this case, an employee may have an association to other
employees; if they do, they are a manager, and the other employees are members
of their staff. The association is navigable in both directions since employees
would know their manager, and a manager knows her staff.</p>
<h3><a name="Multiple Associations">Multiple Associations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Drawing two associations between classes means objects are related twice; a
given object can be linked to different objects through each association. Each
association is independent, and is distinguished by the role name. As shown
above, a Customer can have associations to different instances of the same
class, each with different role names.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_roles_on_associations__order_property"></a><a name="Ordered Roles">Ordering
Roles</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>When the multiplicity of an association is greater than one, the associated
instances may be <b>ordered</b>. The <b>ordered </b>property
on a role indicates that the instances participating in the association are
ordered; by default they are an unordered set. The model does not specify <b>how
</b>the ordering is maintained; the operations that update an ordered
association must specify where the updated elements are inserted.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_links__guidelines_for"></a><a name="Links">Links</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The individual instances of an association are called <b>links; </b>a
link is thus a relationship among instances. Messages may be sent on links, and
links may denote references and aggregations between objects. See <a href="md_coldm.htm">Guidelines:
Collaboration Diagram</a> for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_control_class__associations¸_recommendations_for_use_of"></a><a name="XE_association__association_classes"></a><a name="Association Classes">Association
Classes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>An <b>association class </b>is an association that also has class
properties (such as attributes, operations, and associations). It is shown by
drawing a dashed line from the association path to a class symbol that holds the
attributes, operations, and associations for the association. The attributes,
operations, and associations apply to the original association itself. Each link
in the association has the indicated properties. The most common use of
association classes is the reconciliation of many-to-many relationships (see
example below). In principle, the name of the association and class should be
the same, but separate names are permitted if necessary. A degenerate
association class just contains attributes for the association; in this case you
can omit the association class name to de-emphasize its separateness.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">Expanding the Employee example from before, consider the case
where an Employee (a staff-person) works for another Employee (a manager). The
manager performs a periodic assessment of the staff member, reflecting their
performance over a specific time period.</p>
<p class="example">The appraisal cannot be an attribute of either the manager or
the staff member alone, but we can associate the information with the
association itself, as shown below:</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/assoc5.gif" alt="example of an association class" width="192" height="214"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The association class <b>Appraisal</b> captures
information relating to the association itself</p>
<h3><a name="XE_association__qualified_associations"></a><a name="Qualified Associations">Qualified
Associations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Qualifiers are used to further restrict and define the set of instances that
are associated to another instance; an object and a qualifier value identify a
unique set of objects across the association, forming a <b>composite key</b>.
Qualification usually reduces the multiplicity of the opposite role; the net
multiplicity shows the number of instances of the related class associated with
the first class and a given qualifier value. Qualifiers are drawn as small boxes
on the end of the association attached to the qualifying class. They are part of
the association, not the class. A qualifier box may contain multiple qualifier
values; the qualification is based on the entire list of values. A <b>qualified
association </b>is a variant form of association attribute.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">Consider the following refinement of the association between <b>Line
Item</b> and <b>Product</b>: a <b>Line Item</b> has an
association to the <b>Product</b> which is ordered. Each Line Item
refers to one and only one Product, while a Product may be ordered on many Line
Items. By qualifying the association with the qualifier <b>ProductCode</b>
we additionally indicate that each product has a unique product code, and that <b>Line
Items</b> are associated with <b>Products</b> using this product
code.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/assoc6.gif" alt="a qualified association" width="138" height="207"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The association between <b>Line Item</b> and <b>Product
</b>has the qualifier <b>ProductCode</b>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_N-ary_associations__guidelines_for"></a><a name="XE_entity_class__associations¸_recommendations_for_use_of"></a><a name="XE_association__N-ary_associations"></a><a name="N-ary Associations">N-ary
Associations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>An n-ary association is an association among three or more classes, where a
single class can appear more than once. N-ary associations are drawn as large
diamonds with one association path to each participating class. This is the
traditional entity-relationship model symbol for an association. The binary form
is drawn without the diamond for greater compactness, since they are the bulk of
associations in a real model. N-ary associations are fairly rare and can also be
modeled by promoting them to classes. N-ary associations can also have an
association class; this is shown by drawing a dashed line from the diamond to
the class symbol. Roles may have role names but multiplicity is more complicated
and best specified by listing candidate keys. If given, the multiplicity
represents the number of instances corresponding to a given tuple of the other
N-1 objects. Most uses of n-ary associations can be eliminated using qualified
associations or association classes. They can also be replaced by ordinary
classes, although this loses the constraint that only one link can occur for a
given tuple of participating objects.</p>
