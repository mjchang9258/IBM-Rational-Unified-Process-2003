<p>The databases and the database processes should be tested as an independent 
  subsystem. This testing should test the subsystems without the target-of-test's 
  User Interface as the interface to the data. Additional research into the Database 
  Management System (DBMS) needs to be performed to identify the tools and techniques 
  that may exist to support the testing identified in the following table.</p>

  <p>Function testing of the target-of-test should focus on any 
    requirements for test that can be traced directly to use cases or business 
    functions and business rules. The goals of these tests are to verify proper 
    data acceptance, processing, and retrieval, and the appropriate implementation 
    of the business rules. This type of testing is based upon black box techniques; 
    that is, verifying the application and its internal processes by interacting 
    with the application via the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and analyzing 
    the output or results. The following table identifies an outline of the testing 
    recommended for each application.</p>

  <p>Load testing is a performance test that subjects the target-of-test 
    to varying workloads to measure and evaluate the performance behaviors and 
    abilities of the target-of-test to continue to function properly under these 
    different workloads. The goal of load testing is to determine and ensure that 
    the system functions properly beyond the expected maximum workload. Additionally, 
    load testing evaluates the performance characteristics, such as response times, 
    transaction rates, and other time-sensitive issues.</p>

  <p>Stress testing is a type of performance test implemented 
    and executed to understand how a system fails due to conditions at the boundary, 
    or outside of, the expected tolerances. This typically involves low resources 
    or competition for resources. Low resource conditions reveal how the target-of-test 
    fails that is not apparent under normal conditions. Other defects might result 
    from competition for shared resources, like database locks or network bandwidth, 
    although some of these tests are usually addressed under functional and load 
    testing.</p>

    they are limited in the data that is available to them. For example, everyone 
    may be permitted to enter data and create new accounts, but only managers 
    can delete them. If there is security at the data level, testing ensures that

    data, however, &quot;user type two&quot; only sees the demographic data for 
    the same client.</p>

  <p>Failover and recovery testing ensures that the target-of-test 
    can successfully failover and recover from a variety of hardware, software, 
    or network malfunctions with undue loss of data or data integrity.</p>
  <p>For those systems that must be kept running, failover testing 
    ensures that when a failover condition occurs, the alternate or backup systems 
    properly &quot;take over&quot; for the failed system without any loss of data 
    or transactions.</p>
  <p>Recovery testing is an antagonistic test process in which 
    the application or system is exposed to extreme conditions, or simulated conditions, 
    to cause a failure, such as device Input/Output (I/O) failures, or invalid 
    database pointers and keys. Recovery processes are invoked, and the application 
    or system is monitored and inspected to verify proper application, or system, 
    and data recovery has been achieved.</p>

        <p>The tests already created for Function and Business 
          Cycle testing can be used as a basis for creating a series of transactions 
          to support failover and recovery testing, primarily to define the tests 
          to be run to test that recovery was successful. 
        <li> 
          <p>Power interruption to the client: power down the PC. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Power interruption to the server: simulate or initiate 
            power down procedures for the server. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Interruption via network servers: simulate or initiate 
            communication loss with the network (physically disconnect communication 
            wires or power down network servers or routers).</li> 
        <li>
        <p>Interruption, communication, or power loss to DASD and 
          DASD controllers: simulate or physically eliminate communication with 
          one or more DASDs or DASD controllers.</p></li>
        <p>Once the above conditions or simulated conditions are 
          achieved, additional transactions should be executed and upon reaching 
          this second test point state, recovery procedures should be invoked. 
        <p>Testing for incomplete cycles utilizes the same technique 
          as described above except that the database processes themselves should 
          be aborted or prematurely terminated.</p>
        <p>Testing for the following conditions requires that a 
          known database state be achieved. Several database fields, pointers, 
          and keys should be corrupted manually and directly within the database 
          (via database tools). Additional transactions should be executed using 
          the tests from Application Function and Business Cycle Testing and full 
          cycles executed.
