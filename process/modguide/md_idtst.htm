  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The following decisions should be made regarding the Test discipline's workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the <a href="../workflow/test/ov_tst_wfd.htm">Test: 
    Workflow</a>. Study the diagram with its <a href="../glossary.htm#guard_condition" target="_blank">guard 
    conditions</a> and the guidelines below.</li>
  <li>Decide what parts of the Test workflow details to perform. One key issue 
    for the Test workflow is to decide what quality dimensions are interesting 
    for the project in general, and most importantly, for each iteration (see 
    <a href="../workflow/test/co_tytst.htm">Concepts: Types of Tests</a>). Decide 
    what appropriate combinations of types of tests you should focus on for the 
    current iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Document the decisions in the Development Case, under the headings <i>Disciplines, 
  Test, Workflow</i>.</p> 
  
  
<h3><a name="DecideHowToUseArtifacts">Decide How to Use Artifacts</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Decide what artifacts to use and how to effectively make use of them. The table 
  below describes those artifacts we recommend you should make use of and those 
  you might consider using in particular contexts. For more detailed information 
  on how to tailor each artifact, and a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages 
  of that specific artifact, read the section titled &quot;Tailoring&quot; for 
  each artifact.</p>
<p>For each artifact, decide how the artifact should be used: Must have, Should 
  have, Could have or Won't have. For more details, see <a href="md_uclaar.htm">Guidelines: 
  Classifying Artifacts</a>.</p>

        <p>Where the project culture is relatively information, it may be appropriate

          In other cases, Test Evaluation Summaries can be included as a section 
          within other Assessment artifacts, such as the <a href="../artifact/ar_itass.htm">Iteration

        <p>Consider whether to maintain a &quot;Master&quot; Test Plan in addition 
          to the &quot;Iteration&quot; Test Plans. The Master Test Plan covers 
          mainly logistic and process enactment information that typically relates

          &amp; expended.</p>

          results are particularly complex.</p>
      </td>
      <td width="40%"> 
        <p>We recommend that on most projects, were the conditions required to 
          conduct a specific test are complex or extensive, you should define 
          Test Cases. You will also need to document Test Cases where they are 
          a contractually required deliverable.</p>
        <p>In most other cases we recommend maintaining the Test-Ideas List and 
          the Implemented Test Scripts instead of detailed textual Test Cases.</p>
        <p>Some projects will simply outline Test Cases at a high level and defer 
          details to the Test Scripts. Another style commonly used is to document 
          the Test Case information as comments within the Test Scripts.</p>

<h3><a name="DecideHowToReviewArtifacts">Decide How to Review Artifacts</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section gives some guidelines to help you decide how you should review 
  the test artifacts. For more details, see <a href="md_review.htm">Guidelines: 
  Review Levels</a>.</p>


<h4>Test Cases<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Test Cases are created by the test team and are usually treated as <b>Informal</b>, 
  meaning they are approved by someone within the test team. </p>
<p>Where useful, Test Cases might be approved by other team members and should 
  then be treated as <b>Formal-Internal</b>.</p>
<p>If a customer wants to validate a product before it's released, some subset 
  of the Test Cases could be selected as the basis for that validation. These 
  Test Cases should be treated as <b>Formal-External</b>.</p>


<h4>Test Scripts<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Test Scripts are usually treated as <b>Informal</b>; that is, they are approved 
  by someone within the test team.</p>
<p>If the Test Scripts are to be used by many testers, and shared or reused for 
  many different tests, they should be treated as <b>Formal-Internal</b>.</p>


<h4>Test artifacts in design and implementation<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Test Classes are found in the Design Model, and Test Components in the Implementation 
  Model. There are also two other related although not test specific artifacts: 
  Packages in the Design Model, and Subsystems in the Implementation Model.</p>
<p>These artifacts are like design and implementation artifacts, however, they're 
  created for the purpose of testing. The natural place to keep them is with the 
  design and implementation artifacts. Remember to name or otherwise label them 
  in such a way that they are clearly separated from the design and implementation 
  of the core system.</p>


<h4>Defects<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Defects are usually treated as <b>Informal</b> and are usually handled in a 
  defect-tracking system. On a small project, you can manage the defects as a 
  simple list, for example, using your favorite spreadsheet. This is only manageable 
  for small systems&#151;when the number of people involved and the amount of defects 
  grow, you'll need to start using a more flexible defect-tracking system.</p>
<p>Another decision to make is whether you need to separate the handling of defects&#151;also 
  known as symptoms or failures&#151;from faults; the actual errors. For small projects, 
  you may manage to track only the defects and implicitly handle the faults. However, 
  as the system grows, you usually need to separate the management of defects 
  from faults. For example, several defects may be caused by the same fault. Therefore, 
  if a fault is fixed, it's necessary to find the reported defects and inform 
  those users who submitted the defects, which is only possible if defects and 
  faults can be identified separately.</p>


<h4>Iteration and Master Test Plans<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In any project where the testing is nontrivial, you need a Test Plan for each 
  Iteration. Optionally you might retain a Master Test Plan. In many cases, it's 
  treated as <b>Informal</b>; that is, it's not reviewed and approved. Where testing 
  has important visibility to external stakeholders, it could be treated as <b>Formal-Internal 
  </b>or even <b>Formal-External</b>.</p>


<h3><a name="DecideOnTestApprovalCriteria">Decide on Iteration Approval Criteria</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You must decide who is responsible for determining if an iteration has met 
  its criteria. Strive to have clearly defined upfront as you enter each iteration 
  how the test effort is expected to demonstrate this, and how it will be measured. 
  This individual or group then decides if the iteration has met its criteria, 
  if the system fulfills the desired quality criteria, and if the Test Results 
  are sufficient and satisfactory to support these conclusions.</p>
<p>The following are examples of ways to handle iteration approval: 
<ul>
  <li>The project management team approves Iteration and the system quality, based 
    on recommendations from the system testers.</li>
  <li>The customer approves the system quality, based on recommendations from 
    the system testers.</li>
  <li>The customer approves the system quality, based on the results of a demonstration 
    that exercises a certain subset of the total tests. This set must be formally 
    defined and agreed before hand, preferably early in the iteration. These test 
    are treated as <b>Formal-External</b>.</li>
  <li>The customer approves the system quality by conducting their own independent 
    tests. Again, the nature of these tests should clearly defined and agreed 
    before hand, preferably early in the iteration. These test are treated as 
    <b>Formal-External</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an important decision&#151;you cannot reach a goal if you don't know what 
  it is.</p>
