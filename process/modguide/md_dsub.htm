<p><a name="XE_layering__partitioning_patterns"></a>Subsystems can be used in a
number of complementary ways, to partition the system into units which
<ul>
  <li>can be independently ordered, configured, or delivered</li>
  <li>can be independently developed, as long as the interfaces remain unchanged</li>
  <li>can be independently deployed across a set of distributed computational
    nodes</li>
  <li>can be independently changed without breaking other parts of the systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, subsystems are ideal for modeling components - the replaceable units 
  of assembly in component-based development - that are larger than a single design 
  class. 
<p>In addition, subsystems can 
<ul>
  <li>partition the system into units which can provide restricted security over 
    key resources</li>
  <li>represent existing products or external systems in the design.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="XE_design_subsystem__identifying_subsystems"></a><a name="Identifying Subsystems">Identifying 
  Subsystems</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A complex analysis class is mapped to a design subsystem if it appears to embody 
  behavior that cannot be the responsibility of a single design class acting alone. 
  A complex design class may also become a subsystem, if it is likely to be implemented 
  as a set of collaborating classes.</p>
<p>Subsystems are also a good means of identifying parts of the system that are 
  to be developed independently by a separate team. If the collaborating design 
  elements can be completely contained within a package along with their collaborations, 
  a subsystem can provide a stronger form of encapsulation than that provided 
  by a simple package. The contents and collaborations within a subsystem are 
  completely isolated behind one or more interfaces, so that the client of the 
  subsystem is only dependent upon the interface. The designer of the subsystem 
  is then completely isolated from external dependencies; the designer (or design 
  team) is required to specify how the interface is realized, but they are completely 
  free to change the internal subsystem design without affecting external dependencies. 
  In large systems with largely independent teams, this degree of de-coupling 
  combined with the architectural enforcement provided by formal interfaces is 
  a strong argument for the choice of subsystems over simple packages.</p>
<p>The design subsystem is used to encapsulate these collaborations in such a 
  way that clients of the subsystem can be completely unaware of the internal 
  design of the subsystem, even as they use the services provided by the subsystem. 
  If the participating classes/subsystems in a collaboration interact only with 
  each other to produce a well-defined set of results, the collaboration and its 
  collaborating design elements should be encapsulated within a subsystem.</p>
<p>This rule can be applied to subsets of collaborations as well. Anywhere part
or all of a collaboration can be encapsulated and simplified, doing so will make
the design easier to understand.</p>

<h3><a name="Modeling Subsystems">Modeling Subsystems</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Subsystems may be modeled as either UML subsystems or UML components. These 
  constructs provide almost equivalent modeling capabilities, including:
<ul>
  <li>can group classes to define a larger granularity component</li>
  <li>can separate the visible interfaces from internal implementation</li>
  <li>can have instances that execute at run-time</li>
</ul>
<p>Some differences between these modeling options are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Subsystems explicitly include the notion of &quot;specification&quot; and 
    &quot;realization&quot; (defined below in the section titled <a href="#Subsystem Specification and Realization">Subsystem 
    Specification and Realization</a>). This can be expressed with components 
    by creating separate &quot;specification&quot; and &quot;realization&quot; 
    models of components.</li>
  <li>Subsystems are also packages. Components, on the other hand, can be composed 
    across packages. If you wish to maintain a packaging hierarchy orthogonal 
    from your component composition, components could be a better choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, by and large, these notations can be used interchangeably. Whether 
  to represent Design Subsystems as UML Subsystems or UML Components is a decision 
  that should be documented in the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project Specific Guidelines</a> 
  tailored for your process/project.</p>
<p>Some other suggestions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each Design Subsystem must be given a name and a short description.</li>
  <li>If your visual modeling tool supports UML packages but not UML subsystems, 
    a package stereotyped as «subsystem» can be used to denote a subsystem.</li>
  <li>The responsibilities of the original analysis class should be transferred 
    to the newly-created subsystem, using the description of the subsystem to 
    document the responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Subsystems That Represent Existing Products">Subsystems That
Represent Existing Products</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Where an existing product is one that exports interfaces, i.e. operations
(and perhaps <a href="../glossary.htm#reception"><b>receptions</b></a>), but
otherwise keeps all details of implementation hidden, then it may be modeled as
a subsystem in the logical view.&nbsp; Examples of products the system uses that
you may be able to represent by a subsystem include:
<ul>
  <li>Communication software (middleware).</li>
  <li>Database access support (RDBMS mapping support).</li>
  <li>Application-specific products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some existing products such as collections of types and data structures (e.g.
stacks, lists, queues) may be better represented as packages, because they
reveal more than behavior, and it is the particular contents of the package that
are important and useful and not the package itself, which is simply a
container.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common utilities, such as math libraries, could be represented as subsystems,
if they simply export interfaces, but whether this is necessary or makes sense
depends on the designer's judgment about the nature of the thing modeled.&nbsp;
Subsystems are object-oriented constructs that are classifiers as well as
packages: a subsystem can have instances (if the designer so indicates). UML
provides another way to model groups of global variables and procedures in the <a href="../glossary.htm#utility"><b>utility</b></a>,
which is a stereotype of class - the utility has no instances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When defining the subsystem to represent the product, also define one or more
interfaces to represent the product interfaces.</p>
<h3><a name="Subsystem Dependency Restrictions">Subsystem Dependency
Restrictions</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Subsystems differ from packages in their semantics: a subsystem is a kind of
package which provides behavior through one or more interfaces which it
realizes. Packages provide no behavior; they are simply containers of things
which provide behavior.</p>
<p>The reason for using a subsystem instead of a package is that subsystems encapsulate 
  their contents, providing behavior only through their interfaces. The benefit 
  of this is that, unlike a package, the contents and internal behaviors of a 
  subsystem can changed with complete freedom so long as the subsystem's interfaces 
  remain constant. Subsystems also provide a 'replaceable design' element: any 
  two subsystems (or classes, for that matter) that realize the same interfaces 
  are interchangeable.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that subsystems are replaceable elements in the model, a
few rules need to be enforced:
<ul>
  <li>A Subsystem should minimize exposing of its contents. Ideally no element 
    contained by a subsystem should have 'public' visibility, and thus no element 
    outside the subsystem depends on the existence of a particular element inside 
    the subsystem. Some exceptions are as follows:
    <ul>
	  <li>The interfaces for the subsystem can be packaged with the subsystem, 
        and made visible. (However, if these interfaces are potentially re-useable, 
        they should be packaged outside the subsystem.)</li>
      <li>In some technologies, the externals of a subsystem cannot be modelled 
        as a UML interface. For example, a Java interface is modelled as a stereotyped 
        class.</li>
      <li>The subsystem design may require exposing classes rather than UML interfaces. 
        For example, a &quot;delegate&quot; or &quot;access&quot; class can be 
        used hide a complex collaboration of other classes. While an ordinary 
        package could be used instead, a subsystem could be used in order to emphasize 
        the intent to encapsulate behaviour and hide internal details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  When a subsystem's externals are not UML interfaces, it is often helpful to 
  have a diagram (for example named "External View") that shows the visible elements 
  of the subsystem. 
  <li>A Subsystem should define its dependencies on subsystem interfaces (and 
    publicly visible elements of subsystems in the exceptional cases described 
    above). In addition, a number of subsystems may share a set of interfaces 
    or class definitions in common, in which case those subsystems 'import' the 
    contents of the packages which contain the common elements. This is more common 
    with packages in lower layers in the architecture, to ensure that common definitions 
    of classes which must pass between subsystems are consistently defined.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of Subsystem and Package dependencies is shown below:</p>

<p class="picturetext">Subsystem and Package Dependencies in the Design Model<br>

<h3><a name="Subsystem Specification and Realization">Subsystem Specification 
  and Realization</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p class="picturetext"> 
<h4><a name="Definition">Definition</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The UML ([<a href="../referenc.htm#UML01">UML01</a>]) states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The contents of a subsystem are divided into two subsets: 1) specification<br>
    elements and 2) realization elements. The specification elements, together 
    with the<br>
    operations and receptions of the subsystem, are used for giving an abstract 
    specification<br>
    of the behavior offered by the realization elements. The collection of realization 
    elements<br>
    model the interior of the behavioral unit of the physical system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The separation of specification and realization essentially allows for two 
  separate descriptions of the subsystem. The specification serves as a contract 
  that defines everything that a client needs to know to use the subsystem. The 
  realization is the detailed internal design intended to guide the implementer.</p>
<p>One option for modeling specifications and realizations, if not directly supported 
  by the modeling environment, is to place two packages, specification and realization, 
  inside each subsystem.</p>
<p>One motivation for specifications is to support multiple realizations. This 
  is not directly supported in the UML. If you wish to support multiple realizations, 
  create separate &quot;realization&quot; subsystems, and draw a realization from 
  each realization subsystem to the specification subsystem.</p>
<p class="picturetext"> 
<h4><a name="When and how to use">When and how to use</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>If the internal state and behaviour of the subsystem is relatively simple, 
  it may be sufficient to specify the subsystem by its exposed interfaces, state 
  diagrams to describe the behaviour, and descriptive text.</p>
<p>For more complex internal state and behaviour, analysis classes can be used 
  to specify the subsystem at a high level of abstraction. For large systems of 
  systems, the specification of a subsystem may also include use cases. See <a href="../../papers/sis.htm">Developing 
  Large-Scale Systems with the Rational Unified Process</a>.</p>
<p>Providing a detailed specification separate from the realization tends to be 
  most useful in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the subsystem realization's internal state or behaviour is complex - and 
    the specification needs to be expressed as simply as possible in order for 
    clients to use it effectively;</li>
  <li>the subsystem is a reusable &quot;assembly component&quot; intended for 
    assembly into a number of systems (see <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_component.htm">Concepts: 
    Component</a>);</li>
  <li>the subsystem's internals are expected to be developed by a separate organization;</li>
  <li>multiple implementations of the subsystem need to be created;</li>
  <li>the subsystem is expected to be replaced with another version that has significant 
    internal changes without changes to the externally visible behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining a separate specification takes effort, however &#151; as one must 
  ensure that the realization of the subsystem is compliant with the specification. 
  The criteria for when and if to create separate specification and realization 
  classes and collaborations should be defined in <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Artifact: 
  Project Specific Guidelines.</a></p>
<h4><a name="Dependencies">Dependencies</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A specification should define its dependencies. These are the interfaces and 
  visible elements from other subsystems and packages that must be available in 
  all compliant realizations of the subsystem.</p>
<p>A realization may have additional dependencies, introduced by the designer 
  or implementer. For example, there may be an opportunity to use a utility component 
  to simplify the implementation - but the use of this utility component is a 
  detail that need not be exposed to clients. These additional dependencies should 
  be captured on a separate diagram as part of the realization.</p>
<h4><a name="Relationship to Implementation">Relationship to Implementation</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A fully detailed specification defines everything a client needs to use the 
  subsystem. This means refining the exposed interfaces and any publicly visible 
  elements so that they are one-to-one with code. Analysis classes introduced 
  to specify the subsystem behaviour should remain as high level abstractions, 
  since they are intended to be independent of any subsystems realizations.</p>
<p>The realization elements of a subsystem should align closely to the code.</p>
<p>See <a href="../workflow/implemen/co_mdesc.htm">Concepts: Mapping from Design 
  to Code</a> for some further discussion on this topic.</p>
