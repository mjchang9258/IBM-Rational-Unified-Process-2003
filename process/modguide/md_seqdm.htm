<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In most cases, we use a sequence diagram to illustrate use-case realizations
(see <a href="../artifact/ar_ucrea.htm">Artifact: Use-Case Realizations</a>),
i.e. to show how objects interact to perform the behavior of all or part of a
use case. One or more sequence diagrams may illustrate the object interactions
which enact a use case. A typical organization is to have one sequence diagram
for the main flow of events and one sequence diagram for each independent
sub-flow of the use case.</p>
<p>Sequence diagrams are particularly important to designers because they
clarify the roles of objects in a flow and thus provide basic input for
determining class responsibilities and interfaces.</p>
<p>Unlike a collaboration diagram, a sequence diagram includes chronological
sequences, but does not include object relationships. Sequence diagrams and
collaboration diagrams express similar information, but show it in different
ways. Sequence diagrams show the explicit sequence of messages and are better
when it is important to visualize the time ordering of messages. When you are
interested in the structural relationships among the instances in an
interaction, use a collaboration diagram. See <a href="md_coldm.htm">Guidelines:
Collaboration Diagram</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You can have objects and actor instances in sequence diagrams, together with
messages describing how they interact. The diagram describes what takes place in
the participating objects, in terms of activations, and how the objects
communicate by sending messages to one another. You can make a sequence diagram
for each variant of a use case's flow of events.</p>

<h4><a name="XE_sequence_diagram__objects_in"></a><a name="XE_object__in_sequence_diagram"></a><b><a name="Objects">Objects</a>
</b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An object is shown as a vertical dashed line called the &quot;lifeline&quot;.
The lifeline represents the existence of the object at a particular time. An
object symbol is drawn at the head of the lifeline, and shows the name of the
object and its class underlined, and separated by a colon:</p>
<p>objectname : classname</p>
<p>You can use objects in sequence diagrams in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>A lifeline can represent an object or its class. Thus, you can use a
    lifeline to model both class and object behavior. Usually, however, a
    lifeline represents all the objects of a certain class.</li>
  <li>An object's class can be unspecified. Normally you create a sequence
    diagram with objects first, and specify their classes later.</li>
  <li>The objects can be unnamed, but you should name them if you want to
    discriminate different objects of the same class.</li>
  <li>Several lifelines in the same diagram can represent different objects of
    the same class; but, as stated previously, the objects should be named that
    so you can discriminate between the two objects.</li>
  <li>A lifeline that represents a class can exist in parallel with lifelines
    that represent objects of that class. The object name of the lifeline that
    represents the class can be set to the name of the class.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Actors">Actors</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Normally an actor instance is represented by the first (left-most) lifeline
in the sequence diagram, as the invoker of the interaction. If you have several
actor instances in the same diagram, try keeping them either at the left-most,
or the right-most lifelines.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_sequence_diagram__messages_in"></a><a name="XE_message__in_sequence_diagram"></a><a name="Messages">Messages</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A message is a communication between objects that conveys information with
the expectation that activity will ensue; in sequence diagrams, a message is
shown as a horizontal solid arrow from the lifeline of one object to the
lifeline of another object. In the case of a message from an object to itself,
the arrow may start and finish on the same lifeline. The arrow is labeled with
the name of the message, and its parameters. The arrow may also be labeled with
a sequence number to show the sequence of the message in the overall
interaction. Sequence numbers are often omitted in sequence diagrams, in which
the physical location of the arrow shows the relative sequence.</p>
<p>A message can be unassigned, meaning that its name is a temporary string that
describes the overall meaning of the message and is not the name of an operation
of the receiving object. You can later assign the message by specifying the
operation of the message's destination object. The specified operation will then
replace the name of the message.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_sequence_diagram__script_in"></a><a name="XE_script__in_sequence_diagrams"></a><a name="Scripts">Scripts</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Scripts describe the flow of events textually in a sequence diagram.</p>
<p>You should position the scripts to the left of the lifelines so that you can
read the complete flow from top to bottom (see figure above). You can attach
scripts to a certain message, thus ensuring that the script moves with the
message.</p>
<h3><a name="Distributing Control">Distributing Control Flow in Sequence
Diagrams</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p><b>Centralized control</b> of a flow of events or part of the flow
of events means that a few objects steer the flow by sending messages to, and
receiving messages from other objects. These controlling objects decide the
order in which other objects will be activated in the use case. Interaction
among the rest of the objects is very minor or does not exist.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the <b>Recycling-Machine System, </b>the use
case <b>Print Daily Report</b> keeps track of - among other things -
the number and type of returned objects, and writes the tally on a receipt. The <b>Report
Generator</b> control object decides the order in which the sums will be
extracted and written.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/md_seqd3.gif" width="385" height="334"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The behavior structure of the use case <b>Print
Daily Report</b> is centralized in the <b>Report Generator</b>
control object.</p>
<p>This is an example of centralized behavior. The control structure is
centralized primarily because the different sub-event phases of the flow of
events are not dependent on each other. The main advantage of this approach is
that each object does not have to keep track of the next object's tally. To
change the order of the sub-event phases, you merely make the change in the
control object. You can also easily add still another sub-event phase if, for
example, a new type of return item is included. Another advantage to this
structure is that you can easily reuse the various sub-event phases in other use
cases because the order of behavior is not built into the objects.</p>
<p><b>Decentralized</b> <b>control</b> arises when the
participating objects communicate directly with one another, not through one or
more controlling objects.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the use case <b>Send Letter</b> someone mails a
letter to another country through a post office. The letter is first sent to the
country of the addressee. In the country, the letter is sent to a specific city.
The city, in turn, sends the letter to the home of the addressee.</p>
<p class="picturelarge" align="center"><img src="images/md_seqd4.gif" width="499" height="310"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The behavior structure of the use case <b>Send
Letter</b> is decentralized.</p>
<p class="example">The use case behavior is a decentralized flow of events. The
sub-event phases belong together. The sender of the letter speaks of
&quot;sending a letter to someone.&quot; He neither needs nor wants to know the
details of how letters are forwarded in countries or cities. (Probably, if
someone were mailing a letter within the same country, not all these actions
would occur.)</p>
<p>The type of control used depends on the application. In general, you should
try to achieve independent objects, that is, to delegate various tasks to the
objects most naturally suited to perform them.</p>
<p>A flow of events with centralized control will have a &quot;fork-shaped&quot;
sequence diagram. On the other hand, a &quot;stairway-shaped&quot; sequence
diagram illustrates that the control-structure is decentralized for the
participating objects.</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center"><img src="images/md_seqd5.gif" width="326" height="399"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A centralized control structure in a flow of events
produces a &quot;fork-shaped&quot; sequence diagram. A decentralized control
structure produces a &quot;stairway-shaped&quot; sequence diagram.</p>
<p>The behavior structure of a use-case realization most often consists of a mix
of centralized and decentralized behavior.</p>
<p>A decentralized structure is appropriate:
<ul>
  <li>If the sub-event phases are tightly coupled. This will be the case if the
    participating objects:
    <ul>
      <li>Form a part-of or consists-of hierarchy, such as Country - State -
        City;</li>
      <li>Form an information hierarchy, such as CEO - Division Manager -
        Section Manager;</li>
      <li>Represent a fixed chronological progression (the sequence of sub-event
        phases will always be performed in the same order), such as
        Advertisement - Order - Invoice -Delivery - Payment; or</li>
      <li>Form a conceptual inheritance hierarchy, such as Animal - Mammal -
        Cat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to encapsulate, and thereby make abstractions of,
    functionality. This is good for someone who always wants to use the whole
    functionality, because the functionality can become unnecessarily hard to
    grasp if the behavior structure is centralized.</li>
</ul>
<p>A centralized structure is appropriate:
<ul>
  <li>If the order in which the sub-event phases will be performed is likely to
    change.</li>
  <li>If you expect to insert new sub-event phases.</li>
  <li>If you want to keep parts of the functionality reusable as separate
    pieces.</li>
</ul>
