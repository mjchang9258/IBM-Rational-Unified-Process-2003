<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Expressed in terms of business modeling, the software development process is 
  a business process, whereas the Rational Unified Process (RUP) product is a 
  generic business process for object-oriented software engineering. A project-specific 
  process is a static configuration of the RUP product; that is, it's a business 
  process for software engineering tailored to a specific project, product, and 
  organization. The development case is a further refinement of this configured 
  process, and focuses on what to do and how to do it.</p>
<p>A development case shows how the generic RUP applies to
the context of your organization. This means that you modify the process and
adapt the terminology.</p>
<p>A development case also provides an overview of the process to be followed, 
  something understood by everyone on the project. For details, the development 
  case should refer to the configured process and other guidelines or styleguides.</p>
<p>The process engineer is responsible for configuring the process, deciding how 
  the development process will look, deploying the process Website, and &quot;installing&quot; 
  the development case in the development organization (team, project or company), 
  and teaching the developers how to use it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that introducing a new development process, such as the RUP, into an organization is always a risk. You must continually
weigh the advantages of a new technique against the cost of introducing the
change. Consider introducing a change from both a managerial and a technical
perspective.</p>
<p>Once a development case is set up by the process engineer, the project
manager instantiates and executes it for the given project. This is often called
<b>process enactment</b>.</p>
<p>As the process unfolds, lessons are learned during the process itself, which
are used by the process engineer as feedback to improve the process.</p>
<h3><a name="Variable Elements in Software Engineering Processes">Variable
Elements in Software Engineering Processes</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This section reviews the constituents of a process that are likely to be
modified, customized, added or suppressed in a given development case.
<ul>
        <li>Disciplines<br>
          A software project would rarely skip one of the disciplines, such as 
          Analysis &amp; Design, Implementation, and so on, completely. In exceptional 
          cases, some disciplines, such as Requirements or Deployment, 
          may have been executed by other organizations. However, it's more likely 
          that specific workflows within or across disciplines would 
          be modified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Artifacts<br>
    Projects are far more likely to differ by the artifacts that they have to
    produce, update, and deliver. At one extremity of the range, imagine a
    totally paperless project that electronically maintains only a small number
    of artifacts, is supported by tools such as spreadsheets, design tools,
    programming tools, and testing tools, and only delivers software and
    documentation electronically on disk, CD or over the World-Wide Web. At the
    other extreme, there are projects that must produce and maintain a much
    larger set of printed documents for contractual, regulatory or
    organizational reasons. In some cases, complete models can be omitted.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Activities<br>
    Activities are likely to vary for at least two reasons. Activities that use
    artifacts as input and produce, or update, artifacts as output are affected
    by the modification of these artifacts; in particular, if some artifact, or
    some element of information in an artifact, is no longer necessary, the
    corresponding steps maybe suppressed or significantly modified. Activities
    are also modified to introduce specific techniques, methods, and tools that
    pertain to the specific application domain or development expertise, such as
    design steps, programming languages, automatic code generation tools,
    measurement techniques, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a more detailed level, other elements of the process can be modified,
added or suppressed:
<ul>
  <li>Steps in activities</li>
  <li>Guidelines and guidance for activities</li>
  <li>Notations, such as using subsets of the UML or using stereotypes to
    address some specific need for some, or all, models</li>
  <li>Checkpoints for inspections and reviews</li>
  <li>Roles</li>
  <li>Tool support to automate some activities</li>
  <li>Terminology changes, for instance to adapt the process to the
    organizational context</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the process engineer must make a wide range of decisions to
create a well-adjusted development case out of the RUP. A
development case may have to be adjusted to take advantage of certain
well-established company practices and standards, such as documents,
terminology, and so on.</p>
<h3><a name="Difficult Configurations">Difficult Configurations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Certain configuration forms are difficult to implement and must be considered
very carefully. For example:
<ul>
  <li>Change in process architecture<br>
    Wide-ranging repackaging of the activities in another set of disciplines to 
    match an existing process or organization may lead to a lot of effort for 
    very little gain. Often, it's more practical to simply establish a mapping 
    to assess whether all aspects are covered by the RUP. Remember that the disciplines 
    are not phases sequentially executed&#151;they are containers for activities, 
    and are executed again and again in each iteration, often concurrently within 
    one iteration.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changes in terminology<br>
    Although substituting one word for another may sound like a trivial exercise
    in word processing, such changes must be considered very carefully. In the
    domain of software engineering, organizations often use the same word with
    slightly different meanings, or different words that mean the same thing.
    Making isolated changes in the RUP may lead to a
    process that is very difficult to understand. One solution is to create a
    &quot;translation table&quot; for the terminology that translates between
    the RUP terminology and the organization's terminology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of dangerous words are system, phase, role, activity, model, and
document.</p>
<p>If the process results are captured in a language other than English, the terminology 
  issues are more complex where you must translate the descriptions of artifacts, 
  documents, reports, and possibly other parts of the RUP to this other language.</p>
<p>The extended RUP tool set provides automation in the area of RUP customization. 
  Refer to the <a href="../res_processworkbench.htm">Rational Process Workbench&#153; 
  product</a> for more information om recommended strategies for tailoring the 
  RUP.</p>
<h3><a name="Delegating Process Responsibility">Delegating Process
Responsibility</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The development case should not capture the entire process. In reality, a lot 
  of responsibility, and decisions about the process, and the artifacts in particular, 
  are delegated to members of the software development project. For example, if 
  there is an experienced, good project manager, you may leave it to this individual 
  to decide on what plans to produce and how to produce them. In the same way, 
  many project managers aren't concerned about how each team member designs his 
  or her part of the system, as long as they deliver the expected functionality 
  on time and within a reasonable level of quality.</p>
<p>One reason for having a process description at all is so several people can
share information. If this is not the case, then the cost of maintaining the
process description may be too high. Therefore, you may decide not to have, or
maintain, the process description for one or several disciplines. This doesn't
mean that you don't put effort into that particular discipline, nor does it mean
that you don't think it's important. For example, you may employ an excellent
test manager, provide all possible support, but leave it to that test manager to
decide how to work and what artifacts to produce.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_development_case__representing_online"></a><a name="Representing a Development Case Online">Representing
a Development Case Online</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A development case can be represented in several different ways:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#One or several web pages">One or several web pages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#A web site with navigational tools">A web site, with
    navigational tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Integrated with RUP online">Integrated with RUP online</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="One or several web pages">One or Several Web pages</a></h4>
<p>It's easiest to represent it as a Microsoft&#174; Word&#174; document, however, 
  we recommend you represent the development case as one or several web pages 
  with hyperlinks to the RUP configuration (project-specific or organizational) 
  as needed. See <a href="../workflow/environm/co_polpr.htm">Concepts: RUP Tailoring</a> 
  for more details.</p>
<h4><a name="A web site with navigational tools">A Web Site with Navigational
Tools</a></h4>
<p>There are great benefits to represent your project-specific process like the 
  RUP Website. By always publishing your project's process from the RUP Builder 
  tool, you get all this for free. The resulting Website has the exact same functionality 
  and look &amp; feel as the classic RUP Website.</p>
<p>We recommend that you integrate the development case in your project web site, 
  if you have one.</p>
<h4><a name="Integrated with RUP online">Integrated with RUP Online</a></h4>
<p>You can also integrate the development case in the RUP online. This can be 
  done using the MyRUP feature on a server based RUP Website. This approach will 
  add a new view into the process configuration, manifested as a separate tab 
  in the RUP Treebrowser. In this view you can add nodes for the pages that constitutes 
  the development case. 
  See <a href="../../toolment/rup/tm_personalize_rup.htm">Tool Mentor: Personalize 
  the RUP Website using MyRUP</a>, for detailed information on how to create Process 
  Views inside the RUP Website.</p>
