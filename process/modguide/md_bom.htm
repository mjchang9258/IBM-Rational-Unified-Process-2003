<p>A Business Analysis Model defines the business use cases from the business 
  workers’ internal viewpoint. The model defines how people who work in the business, 
  as well as the things they handle and use (&quot;the classes and objects of 
  the business&quot;) must relate to one another, both statically and dynamically, 
  to produce the expected results. It places emphasis on roles performed in the 
  business area and their active responsibilities. Together, the objects of the 
  model’s classes should be capable of performing all business use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key elements of the Business Analysis Model are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="md_orgun.htm">Business Systems</a> partition large business models 
    into interdependent areas of responsibilities.</li>
  <li><a href="md_bwk.htm">Business Workers</a> show the set of responsibilities 
    a person may carry.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="md_bent.htm">Business Entities</a> represent deliverables, resources, 
    and events that are used or produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="md_bevnt.htm">Business Events</a> represent important occurrences 
    in the daily operation of the business. &nbsp;</li>
  <li><a href="md_bucr.htm">Business Use-Case Realizations</a> show how business 
    workers, business entities, and business events collaborate to perform a workflow. 
    The Business Use-Case Realizations are documented with:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="md_bactdbom.htm#ClassDiagrams">Class diagrams</a> that show participating
      business workers and business entities.</li>
    <li><a href="md_bactdbom.htm#ActivityDiagrams">Activity diagrams</a> in which swimlanes show 
      responsibilities of business workers, and object flows show how business 
      entities are used in the workflow.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><a href="md_bactdbom.htm#SequenceDiagrams">Sequence diagrams</a> that depict the details of
      the interaction among business workers, business actors, and how business
      entities are accessed, during the performance of a business use
      case.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Business Analysis Model brings the notions of structure and behavior together. 
  Business Use-Case Realizations map the descriptions of process (Business Use 
  Cases), which specify desired behavior, to structural <b> </b> elements <b> 
  </b>within the organization. (See the figure that appears after the bullets.)</p>
<p>The following are some characteristics of the Business Analysis Model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a bridging artifact that articulates business concerns in a way <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">that is </span> similar to how software developers 
    think, while still retaining a purely business content. It is a consolidation 
    of what we know about the area of business concern expressed in terms of objects, 
    attributes, and responsibilities.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It explores the essence of business area knowledge in a way that provides
    a transition from thinking about business issues to thinking about software
    applications.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>It is a way of firming up requirements to be enabled or supported by
    information system that will be built.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The process of agreeing to business object definitions, relationships between 
    objects, and the names for the objects and relationships between objects, 
    permits business area knowledge to be represented in a precise manner that 
    can be understood and validated by business-area experts.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="XE_business_worker__naming_guidelines"></a><a name="XE_business_entity__naming_guidelines"></a><a name="How to Name Business Workers and Business Entities">Naming
Conventions</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In general, Business Systems, Business Workers, Business Entities, and Business 
  Events should have short, descriptive names that are unique and are not similar 
  to other names. Sometimes it may be necessary to use more than one word to describe 
  the purpose of the model element and ensure that it is unique and recognizable, 
  especially when considering a broader context (which may become important in 
  the future).</p>
<p>A Business System provides a collection of related responsibilities with a 
  specific purpose, and should be named in a way that reflects this purpose. It 
  may be tempting to use generic names or catch phrases for names (such as Client 
  Services), but make sure that the term is really applicable and descriptive. 
  Generally, a gerund form of a verb is useful (such as Shipping, Invoicing, or 
  Selling) as is a referral to the purpose of the Business System (such as Customer 
  Management or Target Acquisition). See <a href="md_orgun.htm">Guidelines: Business 
  System</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Business Workers should be named in a way that expresses their responsibilities. 
  Do not describe the function (in case of a human business worker), but the role 
  played by the business worker in the use-case realization. This role is reflected 
  by the purpose with which the business worker is involved in the business use-case 
  realization. See <a href="md_bwk.htm">Guidelines: Business Worker</a> for more 
  information.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a process in which data is typed into a system by one 
  business worker and held until a second business worker has verified or approved 
  the data before processing (such as in loan applications at a bank). The business 
  worker who inputs the data could be named Data Typist or Data Entry Clerk, whereas 
  the second business worker could be named Verifier, Authorizer, or Releaser. 
  Data Entry Clerk has the disadvantage of sounding human, while the last three 
  may have to be further qualified at some stage (for example, Mortgage Authorizer 
  if the bank is also going to start brokering insurance policies).</p>
<p>Business Entities should be named in a way that reflects the information they 
  represent. Business entities must always be defined in the Business Glossary, 
  since there is usually much difference of opinion regarding definitions and 
  relationships. Do not include the state or properties of the Business Entity 
  in its name. Business Entity names should be singular, not plural. See <a href="md_bent.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Entity</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Business Events should be named in a way that indicates the occurrence or state 
  changed that it represents. Do not describe the trigger of the event or the 
  reaction to the event in the name. The specification of the event is independent 
  of its triggers. See <a href="md_bevnt.htm">Guidelines: Business Event</a> for 
  more information.</p>
<h3><a name="Business Objects in Relation to Business Use Cases">Business
Objects in Relation to Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>As you study the business workers and business entities that participate in 
  your business’ different use cases, you may find several that are so similar 
  that they are really one class. Even when different business use cases do not 
  have identical demands, the classes may be similar enough to be considered one 
  and the same phenomenon. If this is the case, merge the similar classes into 
  one. This results in a business worker or business entity that has sufficient 
  relationships, attributes, and operations to meet all the demands of the different 
  business use cases. The diagram at the end of the section titled &quot;Explanation&quot; 
  shows how business workers and business entities participate in different business 
  use-case realizations.</p>
<p>Several business use cases may, therefore, have quite different demands on
one and the same class. In the case of business workers, if you have employees
capable of acting in the described set of roles, you will also have flexible
employees who can work in several positions. This gives you a more flexible
business.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_information_systems__business-object_model¸_relationship_to"></a><a name="XE_business_object_model__information_systems¸_the_relationship_to"></a><a name="The Business Analysis Model and Information Systems">The
Business Analysis Model and Information Systems</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In the Business Analysis Model, Business Workers represent the roles that the 
  employees will act, whereas Business Entities represent those things that the 
  employees will handle. Using a Business Analysis Model, you define how the employees 
  of the business need to interact to produce the desired results for the business 
  actor. The System Use-Case Model and Design Model, on the other hand, specify 
  the business’ information systems.</p>
<p>Business modeling and software modeling address two different problem areas 
  at two different abstraction levels. Therefore, the general rule is that the 
  information systems must have no direct presence in the business models.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the employees acting as business workers use information 
  systems to communicate with each other, and with the actors, and to access information 
  about business entities. Whenever there is a link, association, or attribute, 
  there is also some potential information-system support.</p>
<p>These two modeling contexts have the following relationships:
<ul>
  <li>An employee acting as a certain business worker corresponds to a system 
    actor of the information system. He or she is probably best supported if the 
    information systems are structured so that his or her entire work in a business 
    use case is supported by one system use case.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, if the business use case is large, long-lived, or combines 
    work from several independent areas, an information-system use case can support 
    one operation of the business worker instead.</li>
  <li>The things the employees work with—modeled as business entities—often
    have representations in the information systems. In the object model of an
    information system, these business entities occur as entity classes.</li>
  <li>Business events are often implemented as messages in service-oriented architecture 
    software systems or as tasks in workflow automation systems.</li>
  <li>Associations and aggregations between business entities often give rise 
    to corresponding association and aggregations between entity classes in the 
    Design Model.</li>
  <li>Therefore, an information system use case accesses and manipulates entity 
    classes in the design model that represent the business entities accessed 
    by the supported business use case.</li>
  <li>Finally, a business actor that directly uses a business’ information
    system also becomes a system actor of the information system.</li>
</ul>
<p>These relations are essential when identifying requirements of the information 
  systems that support the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the section on automated business workers in <a href="md_bmtse.htm">Guidelines: 
  Going from Business Models to Systems</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<b><a name="Information Systems as Business Actors">Information Systems as
Business Actors</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the employees of one business contact the employees of another business 
  through the use of the other business’ information system. From the perspective 
  of the modeled business, that information system is a business actor.</p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">A software developer tries to understand a problem in the product 
  for which he is responsible. To understand if the problem originates from the 
  programming tool he is using, he contacts the supplier’s World Wide Web server 
  and studies the list of known problems in the current release of the programming 
  tool. In this way, the business worker Software Developer interacts with the 
  business actor Supplier WWW Server.</p>
<h3>
<b><a name="Information Systems Explicitly in the Business Analysis Model">Information
Systems Explicitly in the Business Analysis Model</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The general rule is that information systems should not be explicitly modeled 
  in the Business Analysis Model; they are merely tools in the hands of the business 
  workers. We have one exception to this rule, which concerns information systems 
  for businesses that are directly used by their customers. If this interaction 
  forms a major part of the business services, it might be so commercially important 
  that you might want to show it in the Business Analysis Model. Telephone banking 
  services are good examples of this type of information system.</p>
<p>From the business-modeling perspective, the following approach is suggested:
<ul>
  <li>Regard the information system as a fully automated business worker that
    interacts with an actor.</li>
  <li>If the information system relates to any of the other business workers or 
    business entities, consider illustrating this relationship with a link or 
    an association. Perhaps the system informs a business worker of its progress 
    or uses information concerning a business entity.</li>
  <li>Briefly describe the business worker, as well as a list of services that 
    represents the information system in the Business Analysis Model.</li>
  <li>Model all details and characteristics of the information system and its 
    environment in an Information System Model.</li>
  <li>Introduce a naming convention so that a fully automated business worker 
    is easily identified among the business workers; for example, a prefix or 
    a suffix, like &quot;automated &lt;business worker name&gt;&quot; or &quot;system: 
    &lt;business worker name&gt;&quot;. You may even define a stereotype with 
    a particular icon.</li>
</ul>

Taken together, the business workers, business entities, and business events perform 
all activities described in the business use cases—no more and no less. The Business 
Analysis Model gives a good, comprehensive picture of the organization.
