the Length of each Iteration</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>We have defined an iteration as a rather complete mini-project, going through
all major disciplines and resulting in most cases in an executable, yet
incomplete, system: a release. Although the cycle [edit, compile, test, debug]
sounds like an iteration, this is not what we mean here. The daily or weekly
builds incrementally integrating and testing more and more elements of the
system may also seem to be an iteration, but that is only a portion of an
iteration, as we use the term here.</p>
<p>An iteration starts with planning and requirements, and ends with a release,
internal or external.</p>
<p>How quickly you can iterate depends mostly on the <b>size</b> of
the development organization.</p>
<p>For example:
<ul>
  <li>Five people can do some planning on a Monday morning, have lunch together
    every day to monitor progress, reallocate tasks, start doing a build on
    Thursday, and complete the iteration by Friday evening.</li>
  <li>But this will be very hard to achieve with 20 people. It will take more
    time to distribute the work, synchronize between subgroups, integrate, and so on.
    An iteration may take rather three or four weeks.</li>
  <li>With 40 people, it already takes a week for the &quot;nervous influx to go
    from the brain to the extremities&quot;. You have intermediate levels of
    management, the common understanding of the objective will require more
    formal documentation, more ceremony. Three month is a more likely reasonable
    iteration length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other factors come into play: the degree of familiarity of the organization
with the iterative approach, including having a stable and mature organization,
the level of automation the team is using to manage code (for example, distributed CM),
distribute information (for example, internal web), automate testing, and so on.</p>
<p>Be aware also that there is some fixed overhead in an iteration, in planning,
synchronizing, analyzing the results, and so on.</p>
<p>So, on one hand, convinced by the tremendous benefits of the iterative
approach, you might be tempted to iterate furiously, the human limits of your
organization are going to slow your fervor.</p>
<p>Some empirical data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Iterations of more than 6 months</b> probably need to have
    intermediate milestones built in to keep the project on track. Consider
    reducing the scope of the iteration to reduce its length and ensure a clear
    focus.</li>
  <li><b>Iterations of more than 12 months</b> create their own risk,
    as the iteration spans the annual funding cycle. A project which has not
    produced anything visible in the past 12 months is at risk of losing its
    funding.</li>
  <li><b>Iterations of less than 1 month</b> need to be scoped
    carefully. Typically, short iterations are more suitable for the
    Construction phase, where the degree of new functionality to be included and
    the degree of novelty are low. Short iterations may do little or no formal
    analysis or design, and may simply be incrementally improving
    well-understood functionality.</li>
  <li><b>Iterations need not all be the same length</b>: their length
    will vary according to their objectives. Typically, elaboration iterations
    will be longer than construction iterations. Within a phase, iterations are
    generally the same length (it makes planning easier).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an idea of the number of iterations in your coarse-grained plan, 
  you need to define the contents of each iteration. It is even a good idea to 
  find a name or title to qualify the product you have at the end of each iteration, 
  to help people get a better focus.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="exampleheading"><a name="Example">Example</a> Iterations for a
  Private Telephone Switch</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Iteration 1: local call.</li>
    <li>Iteration 2: add external calls and subscriber management.</li>
    <li>Iteration 3: add voice mail and conference calls.</li>
  </ul>

<h3><a name="XE_iteration__number_of_iterations_guidelines_for"></a><a name="Number">Determining
the Number of Iterations</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A very simple project may have only one iteration per phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One iteration in the inception phase, producing perhaps a proof-of-concept
    prototype, or user-interface mock-up, or no iteration at all, in the case
    for example of an evolution cycle.</li>
  <li>One iteration in the elaboration phase to produce an architectural
    prototype.</li>
  <li>One iteration in the construction phase to build the product (up to a
    &quot;beta&quot; release).</li>
  <li>One iteration in transition to finish the product (full product release).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more substantial project, in its initial development cycle the norm would 
  be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One iteration in the inception phase (possibly producing a prototype).</li>
  <li>Two iterations in the elaboration phase; one for an architectural
    prototype, and one for the architectural baseline.</li>
  <li>Two iterations in the construction phase to expose a partial system, and
    mature it.</li>
  <li>One iteration in the transition phase to go from initial operational
    capability to full product release.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a large project, with lots of unknowns, new technologies, and the like, 
  there may be a case for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an additional iteration in the inception phase, to allow for more
    prototyping.</li>
  <li>an additional iteration in the elaboration phase, to allow different
    technologies to be explored.</li>
  <li>an additional iteration in the construction phase because of the sheer
    size of the product.</li>
  <li>an additional iteration in the transition phase to allow for operational
    feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>So over a development cycle, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Low: 3 iterations [0,1,1,1]</li>
      <li>Typical: 6 [1, 2, 2, 1]</li>
      <li>High: 9 [1, 3, 3, 2]</li>
      <li>Very High: 10 [2, 3, 3, 2]</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in general, plan to have <b>three to ten</b> iterations. Observe though 
  that the upper and lower bounds connote unusual circumstances, so most developments 
  will use <b>six to eight</b> iterations.</p>
<p>Many variations are possible depending on risks, size, complexity:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>If the product is intended for some totally new domain</b>,
    you may need to add some iterations in the inception phase to consolidate
    the concepts, show various mock-ups to a cross-section of customers or end
    users, or build a solid response to a request for proposal.</li>
  <li><b>If a new architecture must be developed</b>, or there is a
    large amount of use-case modeling, or there are very challenging risks, you
    should plan to have two or three iterations in the elaboration phase.</li>
  <li><b>If the product is large and complex</b>, and developed over a
    long period, you should plan to have three or more iterations in the
    construction phase.</li>
  <li>You should plan to have several iterations in the transition phase if,
    because you must minimize the time to market, you must deliver the product
    with a reduced set of functionality, or if you feel you may need a lot of
    small adaptations to the end-user base after a period of use.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="XE_software_development_plan__traditional_reviews__guidelines_for_mapping"></a><a name="TraditionalReviewsAndTheIterativeApproach">Aligning
the Traditional Waterfall Review Sequence with the Iterative Approach</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The default review sequence for a waterfall life-cycle project has a single 
  major review at the completion of the important artifacts, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>System Requirements Review (SRR)</b>, at the completion of
    the system specification;</li>
  <li><b>Software Specification Review (SSR)</b>, at the completion of
    the software requirements specification;</li>
  <li><b>Preliminary Design Review (PDR)</b>, at the completion of the
    architectural design sections of the software design description;</li>
  <li><b>Critical Design Review (CDR)</b>, at the completion of the
    detailed design sections of the software design description.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Rational Unified Process (RUP), parts of the equivalent artifacts are 
  reviewed as they are completed in each iteration, but the major milestones (and 
  therefore reviews) are aligned with the completion of the <a href="../itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">phases</a>, 
  inception, elaboration, construction and transition. A Project Manager wanting 
  to adopt the RUP may have to find a way to reconcile this apparent conflict, 
  because of contractual obligations. Ideally, the Project Manager should convince 
  the customer that the phase and iteration based approach in fact gives greater 
  true visibility into project progress, and reduces risk, so that there is no 
  need for an SRR, an SSR, and so forth. However, this is not always possible, 
  and the Project Manager has to schedule these reviews at appropriate points. 
  It is possible, in the RUP, to locate the points at which these important artifacts 
  (actually, their equivalents in the RUP) are essentially complete, although 
  this does not always neatly align with phases or iterations.</p>
<p>This is done here by assuming that the relative effort that will be spent on 
  requirements, design, and the like will be approximately the same in the RUP 
  as in the (ideal) waterfall life cycle - but that the effort will be distributed 
  differently. The result is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the SRR (concerned mainly with the <a href="../artifact/ar_vsion.htm">Vision</a>)
    can be scheduled at the end of the inception phase;</li>
  <li>the SSR (concerned mainly with the <a href="../artifact/ar_srs.htm">Software
    Requirements Specification</a>) at about 1/3 of the way through the
    elaboration phase;</li>
  <li>the PDR (concerned mainly with the <a href="../artifact/ar_sadoc.htm">Software
    Architecture Document</a>) at the end of the elaboration phase;</li>
  <li>the CDR (concerned mainly with the <a href="../artifact/ar_desmd.htm">Design
    Model</a>) at about 1/3 of the way through the construction phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>For efficiency, the Project Manager, in consultation with the customer, should 
  attempt to combine these reviews with the prescribed RUP reviews. This is clearly 
  possible for the SRR and the PDR, they can be combined with <a href="../itrwkfls/ms_lco.htm">Lifecycle 
  Objectives Milestone</a> Review and the <a href="../itrwkfls/ms_lca.htm">Lifecycle 
  Architecture Milestone</a> Review, respectively. 
  It is not so obvious for the SSR and CDR. However, observing that almost all projects will have at least 
  two iterations in elaboration and at least two in construction, it is recommended 
  that SSR be combined with the <a href="../activity/ac_iacrv.htm">Iteration Acceptance 
  Review</a> for the first iteration in the elaboration phase, and CDR be combined 
  with the Iteration Acceptance Review for the first iteration in construction. 
  In both cases, there is then good visibility of mature artifacts, with enough 
  time remaining for correction - although the iterative approach should cope 
  with this as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Just as the software process is influenced by the project's characteristics, 
  so is the project organization. The default structure presented here (see the 
  figure below), has to be adapted to reflect the effects of factors such as the 
  ones listed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Business Context</li>
  <li>The Size of the Software Development Effort</li>
  <li>The Degree of Novelty</li>
  <li>Type of Application</li>
  <li>The Current Development Process</li>
  <li>Organizational Factors</li>
  <li>Technical and Managerial Complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>These are key distinguishing factors when analyzing how the organization as 
  a whole should adopt a new development process, here we will examine their effect 
  on the choice of project structure. The figure below presents a default project 
  organization, showing how responsibilities are assigned to the team structure.</p>

<p class="picturetext">Figure showing Default Project Organization. Note that 
  there is no significance in terms of seniority or authority in the ordering 
  of the roles.</p>
  
<p>This figure is a starting point for considering how project-level roles and 
  responsibilities should be mapped to a structure of teams. The figure also serves 
  to emphasize that roles (shown in the yellow boxes) are not individuals, but 
  &quot;hats&quot; an individual (or a team) can wear in the project. It is for 
  this reason that some roles (the Project Manager, for example) appear more than 
  once. This indicates that, at some time, the behavior of the Project Manager, 
  as defined in the RUP, may appear in more than one team. For example, in a large 
  project, the task of preparing a status report based on a Work Breakdown Structure 
  may be delegated to an <b>individual</b> in the Administration Team. However, 
  this is a responsibility that the RUP assigns to the <b>role</b> called 
  Project Manager.</p>
<p>In a small project, it is likely that an <b>individual</b> nominated as Project 
  Manager will perform all the activities of the <i>role</i> called Project Manager, 
  in which case the Administration Team coalesces with the Software Management 
  Team. The selection of team structure will be influenced by the nature and size 
  of the project but should be tempered by some, largely common-sense, rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>small teams are usually more productive; however, in a large project this
    has to be balanced against the amount of cross-team interaction;</li>
  <li>deep hierarchies are to be avoided;</li>
  <li>the span of control of any manager or team lead should be limited to seven
    plus or minus two;</li>
  <li>the software development <b><a name="team structure">team structure</a></b> 
    should be driven by the software architecture (<b>not</b> vice versa); a good 
    architecture, with high cohesion and low coupling between subsystems, will 
    allow teams to work more effectively in parallel;</li>
  <li>testing, other than unit test, should ideally be performed by a team
    separate from the development team. Note, however, that this may not make
    economic sense in a very small project;</li>
  <li>the structure must allow all teams and individuals to be given clearly
    defined authorities and responsibilities. This is particularly important if
    the hierarchy exceeds three levels. The managers and team leads in the
    middle of such structures need to understand what is required of them in
    balancing technical and managerial activities.</li>
  <li>the structure must support the capabilities, experience and motivations of
    the staff: for example, if a single team is supposed to perform analysis,
    design and implementation, without any intermediate hand-off, it will need
    all the necessary competencies. Skilled analysts are not necessarily good
    implementers;</li>
  <li>team structures should not be rigid: individuals will migrate between
    teams over the project's lifetime, and the responsibilities of teams will
    change as the emphasis of the project shifts from phase to phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rationale for the default organization is discussed at length in [<a href="../referenc.htm#ROY98">ROY98</a>]. 
  In particular, the assignment of responsibilities for deployment to the software 
  assessment team recognizes that, of all the teams in a development project, 
  the software assessment team has greatest exposure to the software as the end 
  user will see it.</p>
<p>During the life of a project, the organization will evolve to support the work 
  breakdown structure captured in the project plan. This is shown in the figure 
  below, which is taken from [<a href="../referenc.htm#ROY98">ROY98</a>].</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/md_prp2.gif" vspace="10" hspace="50" width="478" height="405"></p>

<p>This evolution emphasizes a different set of activities in each phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Inception team: an organization focused on planning, with enough
    support from the other teams to ensure that the plans represent a consensus
    of all perspectives;</li>
  <li>the Elaboration team: an architecture-focused organization in which the
    driving forces of the project reside in the software architecture team and
    are supported by the software development and software assessment teams as
    necessary to achieve a stable architecture baseline;</li>
  <li>the Construction team: a balanced organization in which most of the
    activity resides in the software development and software assessment teams;</li>
  <li>the Transition team: a customer-focused organization in which usage
    feedback drives the deployment activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Migration between teams during this evolution will ensure that knowledge and 
  capability is retained in the project. For example, when elaboration is complete, 
  some architecture team members could be dispersed into the development teams, 
  perhaps to act as team leads, or carry the architectural 'vision' into development. 
  Later still, towards the end of the construction phase, the focus shifts to 
  the assessment team, and there is a movement of staff from the development team 
  into the assessment team. It is also important at that stage, to avoid the loss 
  of architectural integrity in the heat of construction, that the influence of 
  the architecture team is not allowed to wane as the 'center of gravity' of the 
  project moves. Moving some architecture team members to the assessment team 
  is one way to do this.</p>
