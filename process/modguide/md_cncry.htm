<p>The art of good design is that of choosing the &quot;best&quot; way to meet a
set of requirements. The art of good concurrent system design is often that of
choosing the simplest way to satisfy the needs for concurrency. One of the first
rules for designers should be to avoid reinventing the wheel. Good design
patterns and design idioms have been developed to solve most problems. Given the
complexity of concurrent systems it only makes sense to use well-proven
solutions and to strive for simplicity of design.</p>
<h3><a name="Concurrency approaches">Concurrency Approaches</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Concurrent activities that take place entirely within a computer, are called <b>threads
of execution</b>. Like all concurrent activities, threads of execution are an
abstract concept since they occur in time. The best we can do to physically
capture a thread of execution is to represent its state at a particular instant
in time.</p>
<p>The most direct way of representing concurrent activities using computers is
to dedicate a separate computer to each activity. However, this usually too
expensive and is not always conducive to conflict resolution. It is common,
therefore, to support multiple activities on the same physical processor through
some form of <b>multi-tasking</b>. In this case, the processor and its
associated resources such as memory and busses are shared. (Unfortunately, this
sharing of resources may also lead to new conflicts that were not present in the
original problem.)</p>
<p>The most common form of multi-tasking is to provide each activity with a
&quot;virtual&quot; processor. This virtual processor is typically referred to
as a <b>process or task</b>. Normally, each process has its own address space
that is logically distinct from the address space of other virtual processors.
This protects processes on conflicting with each other against accidental
overwrites of each other's memory. Unfortunately, the overhead required to
switch the physical processor from one process to another is often prohibitive.
It involves significant swapping of register sets within the CPU (<b>context
switching</b>) that even with modern high-speed processors may take hundreds of
microseconds.</p>
<p>To reduce this overhead, many operating systems provide the ability to
include multiple <b>lightweight threads</b><i> </i>within a single process. The
threads within a process share the address space of that process. This reduces
the overhead involved in context switching, but increases the likelihood of
memory conflicts.</p>
<p>For some high-throughput applications, even the overhead of lightweight
thread switching may be unacceptably high. In such situations it is common to
have an even lighter-weight form of multi-tasking that is achieved by taking
advantage of some special features of the application.</p>
<p>The concurrency requirements of the system can have a dramatic impact upon
the architecture of the system. The decision to move functionality from a uni-process
architecture to a multi-process architecture introduces significant changes to
the structure of the system, in many dimensions. Additional mechanisms (e.g.
remote procedure calls) may need to be introduced which may substantially change
the architecture of the system.</p>
<p>System availability requirements must be considered, as well as the
additional overhead of managing the additional processes and threads.</p>
<p>As with most architectural decisions, changing the process architecture
effectively trades one set of problems for another:</p>

<p>A typical evolutionary path is to start with a uni-process architecture,
adding processes for groups of behaviors that need to occur simultaneously.
Within these broader groupings, consider additional needs for concurrency,
adding threads within processes to increase concurrency.</p>
<p>The initial starting point is to assign many active objects to a single operating system task
or thread, using a purpose-built active object scheduler - this way it is
usually possible to achieve a very lightweight simulation of concurrency,
although, with a single operating system task or thread, it will not be possible
to take advantage of machines with multiple CPUs.&nbsp; The key decision is to isolate blocking behavior in separate
threads, so that blocking behavior does not become a bottleneck. This will
result in a separation of active objects with blocking behavior into their own
operating system threads.</p>

<p class="reactive">In real-time systems, this reasoning applies equally to
capsules - each capsule has a logical thread of control, which may or may not
share an operating system thread, task or process with other capsules.</p>

<h3><a name="Issues">Issues</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, like many architectural decisions, there are no easy answers;
the right solution involves a carefully balanced approach. Small architectural
prototypes can be used to explore the implications of a particular set of
choices. In prototyping the process architecture, focus on scaling the number of
processes up to the theoretical maximums for the system. Consider the following
issues:
<ul>
  <li>Can the number of processes be scaled up to the maximum? How far beyond
    the maximum can the system be pushed? Is there allowance for potential
    growth?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of changing some of the processes to lightweight
    threads which operate in a shared process address space?</li>
  <li>What happens to response time as the number of processes are added? As the
    amount of inter-process communication (IPC) is increased? Is there
    noticeable degradation?</li>
  <li>Could the amount of IPC be reduced by combining or reorganizing processes?
    Would such a change result in large monolithic processes which are difficult
    to load-balance?</li>
  <li>Can shared memory be used to reduce IPC?</li>
  <li>Should all processes get &quot;equal time&quot; when time resources are
    allocated? Is it possible to carry the time allocation? Are there potential
    draw-backs to changing the scheduling priorities?</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Inter-Object Communications">Inter-Object Communications</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
</b></font>
<p>Active objects can communicate with each other synchronously or
asynchronously. Synchronous communication is useful because it can simplify
complex collaborations through strictly controlled sequencing. That is, while an
active object is executing a run-to-completion step that involves synchronous
invocations of other active objects, any concurrent interactions initiated by
other objects can be ignored until the full sequence is completed.</p>
<p>While this is useful in some cases, it can also be problematic since it can
happen that a more important high-priority event may have to wait (priority
inversion). This is exacerbated by the possibility that the synchronously
invoked object may itself be blocked waiting on a response to a synchronous
invocation of its own. This can lead to unbounded priority inversion. In the
most extreme case, if there is circularity in the chain of synchronous
invocations, it can lead to deadlock.</p>
<p>Asynchronous invocations avoid this problem enabling bounded response times.
However, depending on the software architecture, asynchronous communication often leads to more complex code since
an active object may have to respond to several asynchronous events (each of
which might entail a complex sequence of asynchronous interactions with other
active objects) at any time. This can be very difficult and error
prone to implement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of an asynchronous messaging technology with assured message delivery
can simplify the application programming task. The application can continue
operation even if the network connection or remote application is unavailable.
Asynchronous messaging does not preclude using it in a synchronous mode.
Synchronous technology will require a connection to be available whenever the
application is available. Because a connection is known to exist, handling
commit processing may be easier.</p>

<p class="reactive">In the approach recommended in the Rational Unified Process
for real-time systems, <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_cpsl.htm">capsules</a>
communicate asynchronously through the use of <a href="../artifact/ar_signa.htm">signals</a>,
according to particular <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_prot.htm">protocols</a>. It is
possible, nevertheless to achieve synchronous communication through the use of
signal pairs, one in each direction.</p>

<font face="Arial"><b>
<h4><a name="Pragmatics">Pragmatics</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
</b></font>
<p>Although the context-switching overhead of active objects may be very low, it is
possible that some applications may still find that cost unacceptable. This
typically occurs in situations where large amounts of data need to be processed
at a high rate. In those cases, we may have to fall back to using passive
objects and more traditional (but higher risk) concurrency management techniques
such as semaphores.</p>
<p>These considerations, however, do not necessarily imply that we must abandon
the active object approach altogether. Even in such data-intensive applications,
it is often the case that the performance sensitive part is a relatively small
portion of the overall system. This implies that the rest of the system can
still take advantage of the active object paradigm.</p>
<p>In general, performance is only one of the design criteria when it comes to
system design. If the system is complex, then other criteria such as
maintainability, ease of change, understandability, etc. are equally if not even
more important. The active object approach has a clear advantage since it hides
much of the complexity of concurrency and concurrency management while allowing
design to be expressed in application-specific terms as opposed to low-level
technology-specific mechanisms.</p>
<h3><a name="Heuristics">Heuristics</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<h4><a name="Focus on interactions">Focus on Interactions between Concurrent
Components</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Concurrent components with no interactions are an almost trivial problem.
Nearly all of the design challenges have to do with interactions among
concurrent activities, so we must first focus our energy on understanding the
interactions. Some of the questions to ask are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the interaction one-directional, bi-directional, or multi-directional?</li>
  <li>Is there a client-server or master slave relationship?</li>
  <li>Is some form of synchronization required?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the interaction is understood, we can think about ways to implement it.
The implementation should be selected to yield the simplest design consistent
with the performance goals of the system. Performance requirements generally include both overall throughput and acceptable latency in the
response to externally generated events.</p>

<p class="reactive">These issues are even more critical for real-time systems,
which are often less tolerant of variations in performance, for example 'jitter'
in response time, or missed deadlines.</p>

<h4><a name="Isolate and encapsulate external interfaces.">Isolate and
Encapsulate External Interfaces</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>It is bad practice to embed specific assumptions about external interfaces
throughout an application, and it is very inefficient to have several threads of
control blocked waiting for an event. Instead, assign a single object the
dedicated task of detecting the event. When the event occurs, that object can
notify any others who need to know about the event. This design is based upon a
well-known and proven design pattern, the &quot;Observer&quot; pattern [<a href="../referenc.htm#GAM94">GAM94</a>].
It can easily be extended for even greater flexibility to the
&quot;Publisher-Subscriber Pattern,&quot; where a publisher object acts as
intermediary between the event detectors and the objects interested in the event
(&quot;subscribers&quot;) [<a href="../referenc.htm#BUS96">BUS96</a>].</p>
<h4><a name="Isolate and encapsulate blocking and polling behavior.">Isolate and
Encapsulate Blocking and Polling Behavior</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Actions in a system may be triggered by the occurrence of externally generated events. One very important
externally generated event may be simply the passage of time
itself, as represented by the tick of a clock. Other external events come from
input devices connected to external hardware, including user interface devices,
process sensors, and communication links to other systems.</p>

<p class="reactive">This is overwhelmingly true for real-time systems, which
typically have high connectivity with the outside world.</p>

<p>In order for software to detect an event, it must be either blocked waiting 
  for an interrupt, or periodically checking hardware to see if the event has 
  occurred. In the latter case, the periodic cycle may need to be short to avoid 
  missing a short lived event or multiple occurrences, or simply to minimize the 
  latency between the event's occurrence and detection.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this is that no matter how rare an event is, some
software must be blocked waiting for it or frequently checking for it. But many
(if not most) of the events a system must handle are rare; most of the time, in
any given system, nothing of any significance is happening.</p>
<p>The elevator system provides many good examples of this. Important events in 
  the life of an elevator include a call for service, passenger floor selection, 
  a passenger's hand blocking the door, and passing from one floor to the next. 
  Some of these events require very time-critical response, but all are extremely 
  rare compared to the time-scale of the desired response time.</p>
<p>A single event may trigger many actions, and the actions may depend upon the
states of various objects. Furthermore, different configurations of a system may
use the same event differently. For example, when an elevator passes a floor the
display in the elevator cab should be updated and the elevator itself must know
where it is so that it knows how to respond to new calls and passenger floor
selections. There may or may not be elevator location displays at each floor.</p>
<h4><a name="Prefer reactive behavior to scheduled behavior.">Prefer Reactive
Behavior to Polling Behavior</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Polling is expensive; it requires some part of the system to periodically
stop what it is doing to check to see if an event has occurred. If the event
must be responded to quickly, the system will have to check for event arrival
quite frequently, further limiting the amount of other work which can be
accomplished.</p>
<p>It is far more efficient to allocate an interrupt to the event, with the
event-dependent code being activated by the interrupt. Though interrupts are
sometimes avoided because they are considered &quot;expensive&quot;, using
interrupts judiciously can be far more efficient than repeated polling.</p>
<p>Cases where interrupts would be preferred as an event-notification mechanism
are those where event arrival is random and infrequent, such that most polling
efforts find that the event had not occurred. Cases where polling would be
preferred are those in which events arrive in a regular and predictable manner
and most polling efforts find that the event has occurred. In the middle, there
will be a point at which one is indifferent to either polling or reactive
behavior - either will do equally well and the choice matters little. In most
cases, however, given the randomness of events in the real world, reactive
behavior is preferred.</p>
<h4><a name="Prefer event notification to data broadcasting">Prefer Event
Notification to Data Broadcasting</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
      <p>Broadcasting data (typically using signals) is expensive, and is typically 
        wasteful - only a few objects may be interested in the data, but everyone 
        (or many) must stop to examine it. A better, less resource consumptive 
        approach is to use notification to inform only those objects who are interested 
        that some event has occurred. Restrict broadcasting to events which require 
        the attention of many objects (typically timing or synchronization events).</p>
<h4><a name="Make heavy use of light-weight mechanisms and light use of heavy-weight mechanisms.">Make
Heavy Use of Light-weight Mechanisms and Light Use of Heavy-weight Mechanisms</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use passive objects and synchronous method invocations where concurrency
    is not an issue but instantaneous response is.</li>
  <li>Use active objects and asynchronous messages for the vast majority of
    application-level concurrency concepts.</li>
  <li>Use OS threads to isolate blocking elements. An active object can be
    mapped to an OS thread.</li>
  <li>Use OS processes for maximum isolation. Separate processes are needed if
    programs need to be started up and shut down independently, and for
    subsystems which may need to be distributed.</li>
  <li>Use separate CPUs for physical distribution or for raw horsepower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most important guideline for developing efficient concurrent
applications is to maximize the use of the lightest weight concurrency
mechanisms. Both hardware and operating system software play a major part in
supporting concurrency, but both provide relatively heavy-weight mechanisms,
leaving a great deal of work to the application designer. We are left to bridge
a big gap between the available tools and the needs of concurrent applications.</p>
<p>Active objects help to bridge this gap by virtue of two key features:
<ul>
  <li>They unify the design abstractions by encapsulating the basic unit of
    concurrency (a thread of control) which can be implemented using any of the
    underlying mechanisms provided by the OS or CPU.</li>
  <li>When active objects share a single OS thread, they become a very
    efficient, light-weight concurrency mechanism which would otherwise have to
    be implemented directly in the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active objects also make an ideal environment for the passive objects
provided by programming languages. Designing a system entirely from a foundation
of concurrent objects without procedural artifacts like programs and processes
leads to more modular, cohesive, and understandable designs.</p>
<h4><a name="Eschew performance bigotry.">Eschew performance bigotry</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>In most systems less than 10% of the code uses more than 90% of the CPU
cycles.</p>
<p>Many system designers act as though every line of code must be
optimized. Instead, spend your time optimizing the 10% of the code that runs
most often or takes a long time. Design the other 90% with an emphasis on
understandability, maintainability, modularity, and ease of implementation.</p>

<h3><a name="Summary">Summary</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Many systems require concurrent behavior and distributed components.
Most programming languages give us very little help with either of these issues.
We have seen that we need good abstractions to understand both the need for
concurrency in applications, and the options for implementing it in software. We
have also seen that, paradoxically, while concurrent software is inherently more
complex than non-concurrent software, it is also capable of vastly simplifying
the design of systems which must deal with concurrency in the real world.</p>
