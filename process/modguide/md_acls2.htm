<p>Analysis classes may be stereotyped as one of the following:
<ul>
  <li>Boundary classes</li>
  <li>Control classes</li>
  <li>Entity classes</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from giving you more specific process guidance when finding classes,
this stereotyping results in a robust object model because changes to the model
tend to affect only a specific area. Changes in the user interface, for example,
will affect only boundary classes. Changes in the control flow will affect only
control classes. Changes in long-term information will affect only entity
classes. However, these stereotypes are specially useful in helping you to
identify classes in analysis and early design. You should probably consider
using a slightly different set of stereotypes in later phases of design to
better correlate to the implementation environment, the application type, and so
on.</p>
<h4><a name="Boundary Class Def">Boundary Class</a> <font face="Bookman" size="2"><img src="../artifact/images/bcls.jpg" width="47" height="31"></font>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A <b>boundary class</b> is a class used to model interaction
between the system's surroundings and its inner workings. Such interaction
involves transforming and translating events and noting changes in the system
presentation (such as the interface).</p>
<p>Boundary classes model the parts of the system that depend on its
surroundings. Entity classes and control classes model the parts that are
independent of the system's surroundings. Thus, changing the GUI or
communication protocol should mean changing only the boundary classes, not the
entity and control classes.</p>
<p>Boundary classes also make it easier to understand the system because they
clarify the system's boundaries. They aid design by providing a good point of
departure for identifying related services. For example, if you identify a
printer interface early in the design, you will soon see that you must also
model the formatting of printouts.</p>
<p>Common boundary classes include windows, communication protocols, printer interfaces, 
  sensors, and terminals. You do not have to model routine interface parts, such 
  as buttons, as separate boundary classes. Generally the entire window is the 
  finest grained boundary object. Boundary classes are also useful for capturing 
  interfaces to possibly nonobject oriented API's, such as legacy code.</p>
<p>You should model boundary classes according to what kind of boundary they represent. 
  Communication with another system and communication with a human actor (through 
  a user interface) have very different objectives. For communication with a human 
  actor, the most important concern is how the interface will be presented to 
  the user. For communication with another system, the most important concern 
  is the communication protocol.</p>
<p>A boundary object (an instance of a boundary class) can outlive a use case
instance if, for example, it must appear on a screen between the performance of
two use cases. Normally, however, boundary objects live only as long as the use
case instance.</p>
<h5>Finding Boundary Classes </h5>
<p>A boundary class intermediates the interface to something outside the system.
Boundary objects insulate the system from changes in the surroundings (changes
in interfaces to other systems, changes in user requirements, etc.), keeping
these changes from affecting the rest of the system.</p>
<p>A system may have several types of boundary classes:
<ul>
  <li><b>User interface classes</b> - classes which intermediate
    communication with human users of the system</li>
  <li><b>System interface classes</b> - classes which intermediate
    communication with other system</li>
  <li><b>Device interface classes</b> - classes which provide the
    interface to devices (such as sensors), which detect external events</li>
</ul>
<h5>Find User-Interface Classes</h5>
<p>Define one boundary class for each use-case actor-pair. This class can be viewed 
  as having responsibility for coordinating the interaction with the actor. You 
  may also define additional boundary classes to represent <b>subsidiary </b>classes 
  to which the primary boundary class delegates some of its responsibilities. 
  This is particularly true for window-based GUI applications, where you may model 
  one boundary object for each window, or one for each form. Only model the key 
  abstractions of the system; do not model every button, list and widget in the 
  GUI. The goal of analysis is to form a good picture of how the system is composed, 
  not to design every last detail. In other words, identify boundary classes only 
  for phenomena in the system or for things mentioned in the <b>flow of events 
  </b>of the use-case realization. </p>
<p>Make sketches, or use screen dumps from a <a href="../artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">user-interface prototype</a>, that illustrate 
  the behavior and appearance of the boundary classes.</p>
<h5>Find System-Interface Classes</h5>
<p>A boundary class which communicates with an external system is responsible
for managing the dialogue with the external system; it provides the interface to
that system for the system being built.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In an Automated Teller Machine, withdrawal of funds must be
verified through the ATM Network, an actor (which in turn verifies the
withdrawal with the bank accounting system). An object called ATM Network
Interface can be identified to provide communication with the ATM Network.</p>
<p>The interface to an existing system may already be well-defined; if it is,
the responsibilities should be derived directly from the interface definition.
If a formal interface definition exists, it may be reverse engineered and we
need not formally define it here; simply make note of the fact that the existing
interface will be reused during design.</p>
<h5>Find Device Interface Classes</h5>
<p>The system may contain elements that act as if they were external (change
value spontaneously without any object in the system affecting them), such as
sensor equipment. Although it is possible to represent this type of external
device using actors, users of the system may find doing so
&quot;confusing&quot;, as it tends to put devices and human actors on the same
&quot;level&quot;. Once we move away from gathering requirements, however, we
need to consider the source for all external events and make sure we have a way
for the system to detect these events.</p>
<p>If the device is represented as an actor in the use-case model, it is easy to
justify using a boundary class to intermediate communication between the device
and the system. If the use-case model does not include these
&quot;device-actors&quot;, now is the appropriate time to add them, updating the
Supplementary Descriptions of the Use Cases where appropriate.</p>
<p>For each &quot;device-actor&quot;, create a boundary class to capture the
responsibilities of the device or sensor. If there is a well-defined interface
already existing for the device, make note of it for later reference during
design.</p>
<h4><a name="Control Class Def">Control Class</a> <font size="2"><img src="../artifact/images/control.jpg" width="36" height="37"></font>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A <b>control class</b> is a class used to model control behavior
specific to one or a few use cases. Control objects (instances of control
classes) often control other objects, so their behavior is of the coordinating
type. Control classes encapsulate use-case specific behavior.</p>
<p>The behavior of a control object is closely related to the realization of a
specific use case. In many scenarios, you might even say that the control
objects &quot;run&quot; the use-case realizations. However, some control objects
can participate in more than one use-case realization if the use-case tasks are
strongly related. Furthermore, several control objects of different control
classes can participate in one use case. Not all use cases require a control
object. For example, if the flow of events in a use case is related to one
entity object, a boundary object may realize the use case in cooperation with
the entity object. You can start by identifying one control class per use-case
realization, and then refine this as more use-case realizations are identified
and commonality is discovered.</p>
<p>Control classes can contribute to understanding the system because they
represent the dynamics of the system, handling the main tasks and control flows.</p>
<p>When the system performs the use case, a control object is created. Control
objects usually die when their corresponding use case has been performed.</p>
<p>Note that a control class does not handle <b>everything</b>
required in a use case. Instead, it coordinates the activities of other objects
that implement the functionality. The control class delegates work to the
objects that have been assigned the responsibility for the functionality.</p>
<h5>Finding Control Classes </h5>
<p>Control classes provide coordinating behavior in the system. The system can
perform some use cases without control objects (just using entity and boundary
objects)&#151;particularly use cases that involve only the simple manipulation of
stored information.</p>
<p>More complex use cases generally require one or more control classes to
coordinate the behavior of other objects in the system. Examples of control
objects include programs such as transaction managers, resource coordinators, and error handlers.</p>
<p>Control classes effectively de-couple boundary and entity objects from one
another, making the system more tolerant of changes in the system boundary. They
also de-couple the use-case specific behavior from the entity objects, making
them more reusable across use cases and systems.</p>
<p>Control classes provide behavior that:
<ul>
  <li>Is surroundings-independent (does not change when the surroundings
    change),</li>
  <li>Defines control logic (order between events) and transactions within a use
    case.</li>
  <li>Changes little if the internal structure or behavior of the entity classes
    changes,</li>
  <li>Uses or sets the contents of several entity classes, and therefore needs
    to coordinate the behavior of these entity classes.</li>
  <li>Is not performed in the same way every time it is activated (flow of
    events features several states).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Determine whether a Control Class is Needed</h5>
<p>The flow of events of a use case defines the order in which different tasks
are performed. Start by investigating if the flow can be handled by the already
identified boundary and entity classes. For simple <b>flows of events </b>which
primarily enter, retrieve and display, or modify information, a separate control
class is not usually justified; the boundary classes will be responsible for
coordinating the use case.</p>
<p>The <b>flows of events </b>should be encapsulated in a separate
control class when it is complex and consists of dynamic behavior that may
change independently from the interfaces (boundary classes) or information
stores (entity classes) of the system. By encapsulating the <b>flows of
events</b>, the same control class can potentially be re-used for a variety
of systems which may have different interfaces and different information stores
(or at least the underlying data structures).</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example: Managing a Queue of Tasks</b></p>
<p class="example">You can identify a control class from the use case Perform
Task in the Depot-Handling System. This control class handles a queue of Tasks,
ensuring that Tasks are performed in the right order. It performs the next Task
in the queue as soon as suitable transportation equipment is allocated. The
system can therefore perform several Tasks at the same time.</p>
<p class="example">The behavior defined by the corresponding control object is
easier to describe if you split it into two control classes, Task Performer and
Queue Handler. A Queue Handler object will handle only the queue order and the
allocation of transportation equipment. One Queue Handler object is needed for
the whole queue. As soon as the system performs a Task, it will create a new
Task Performer object, which will perform the Task. We thus need one Task
Performer object for each Task the system performs.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../activity/images/splitclass.gif" alt="&quot;too complex&quot; classes should be split into classes with a consistent, related set of responsibilities" width="403" height="164"></p>
<p align="CENTER" class="picturetext">Complex classes should be divided along
lines of similar responsibilities</p>
<p class="example">The principal benefit of this split is that we have separated
queue handling responsibilities (something generic to many use cases) from the
specific activities of task management, which are specific to this use case.
This makes the classes easier to understand and easier to adapt as the design
matures. It also has benefits in balancing the load of the system, as many
Task Performers can be created as necessary to handle the workload.</p>
<h5>Encapsulating the Main Flow of Events and Alternate/Exceptional Flows of
Events in separate Control Classes</h5>
<p>To simplify changes, encapsulate the main flow of events and alternate flows
of events in different control classes. If alternate and exception flows are
completely independent, separate them as well. This will make the system easier
to extend and maintain over time.</p>
<h5>Divide Control Classes where two Actors share the same Control Class</h5>
<p>Control classes may also need to be divided when several actors use the same
control class. By doing this, we isolate changes in the requirements of one
actor from the rest of the system. In cases where the cost of change is high or
the consequences dire, you should identify all control classes which are related
to more than one actor and divide them. In the ideal case, each control class
should interact (via some boundary object) with one actor or none at all.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example: Call Management</p>
<p class="example">Consider the use case <b>Local Call</b>. Initially,
we can identify a control class to manage the call itself.</p>
<p align="CENTER" class="example"><img src="../activity/images/ac_ucan2.gif" alt="Different actors invloved in a use case usually require separate control classes" width="362" height="295"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The control class handling local phone calls in a
telephone system can quickly be divided into two control classes, <b>A-behavior</b>
and <b>B-behavior</b>, one for each actor involved.</p>
<p class="example">In a local phone call, there are two actors: <b>A-subscriber</b>
who initiates the call, and <b>B-subscriber</b> who receives the call.
The <b>A-subscriber </b>lifts the receiver, hears the dial tone, and
then dials a number of digits, which the system stores and analyzes. When the
system has received all the digits, it sends a ringing tone to <b>A-subscriber</b>,
and a ringing signal to <b>B-subscriber</b>. When <b>B-subscriber
</b>answers, the tone and the signal stop, and the conversation between the
subscribers can begin. The call is finished when both subscribers hang up.</p>
<p class="example">Two behaviors must be controlled: What happens at
A-subscriber’s place and what happens at B-subscriber’s place. For this
reason, the original control object was split into two control objects, <b>A-behavior
</b>and <b>B-behavior</b>.</p>
<p>You do not have to divide a control class if:
<ul>
  <li>You can be reasonably sure that the behavior of the actors related to the
    objects of the control class will never change, or change very little.</li>
  <li>The behavior of an object of the control class toward one actor is very
    insignificant compared with its behavior toward another actor, a single
    object can hold all the behavior. Combining behavior in this way will have a
    negligible effect on changeability.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Entity Class Def">Entity Class</a> <font size="2"><img src="../artifact/images/entity.jpg" width="37" height="37"></font>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An <b>entity class</b> is a class used to model information and
associated behavior that must be stored. Entity objects (instances of entity
classes) are used to hold and update information about some phenomenon, such as
an event, a person, or some real-life object. They are usually persistent,
having attributes and relationships needed for a long period, sometimes for the
life of the system.</p>
<p>An entity object is usually not specific to one use-case realization;
sometimes, an entity object is not even specific to the system itself. The
values of its attributes and relationships are often given by an actor. An
entity object may also be needed to help perform internal system tasks. Entity
objects can have behavior as complicated as that of other object stereotypes.
However, unlike other objects, this behavior is strongly related to the
phenomenon the entity object represents. Entity objects are independent of the
environment (the actors).</p>
<p>Entity objects represent the key concepts of the system being developed.
Typical examples of entity classes in a banking system are <b>Account</b>
and <b>Customer.</b> In a network-handling system, examples are <b>Node</b>
and <b>Link</b>.</p>
<p>If the phenomenon you wish to model is not used by any other class, you can
model it as an attribute of an entity class, or even as a relationship between
entity classes. On the other hand, if the phenomenon is used by any other class
in the design model, you must model it as a class.</p>
<p>Entity classes provide another point of view from which to understand the
system because they show the logical data structure, which can help you
understand what the system is supposed to offer its users.</p>
<h5>Finding Entity Classes </h5>
<p>Entity classes represent stores of information in the system; they are
typically used to represent the key concepts the system manages. Entity objects
are frequently passive and persistent. Their main responsibilities are to store
and manage information in the system.</p>
<p>A frequent source of inspiration for entity classes are the Glossary
(developed during requirements) and a business-domain model (developed during
business modeling, if business modeling has been performed).</p>

  <li>Communicate associations between two Boundary classes, for instance, to describe how a
    specific window is related to other boundary objects.</li>
  <li>Communicate or subscribe associations from a Boundary class to an Entity class, because boundary

  <li>Communicate associations from a Boundary class to a Control class, so that

<p>Entity classes should only be the source of associations (communicate or
subscribe) to other entity classes. Entity
class objects tend to be long-lived; control and boundary class objects tend to
be short-lived. It is sensible from an architectural viewpoint to limit the
visibility that an entity object has of its surroundings, that way, the system
is more amenable to change.</p>
