<rpw name="PresentationName">Sample Iteration Plan</rpw>: Inception Phase</h2>
<p>This is an example of a typical iteration in the Inception Phase of a project 
  following the <b>Classic RUP configuration </b>or similar. This illustration 
  shows how a project begins, and how the various workflows relate. It is constructed 
  from the Workflow Details as they would appear at the time of the first iteration 
  of the project. The intent is to indicate dependencies and show where workflows 
  occur in parallel. The lengths of the bars in the chart (indicating duration) 
  have no absolute significance. For example, it is not intended to convey that 
  Conceive New Project and Define Evaluation Mission must have the same duration. 
  There is also no intention to suggest the application of a uniform level of 
  effort across the duration of the workflows. An indication of the relative effort 
  can be seen in the <a href="../ovu_proc.htm">Process Overview.</a> You can navigate 
  to the corresponding Workflow Detail pages from each line of the chart - just 
  click on the Workflow Detail name. This illustration was created from a <a href="../../prjtmpl/mgmt/mp_incepit.htm">Microsoft 
  Project Plan</a>.</p>

    <td width="15%"><b>Preliminary: Define the Business Context (optional)</b></td>
    <td width="85%">In cases where the system is being built to support a new or
    significantly changed business process, some context-setting business
    engineering can help to better define the environment in which the system
    will operate. This is especially useful if the stakeholders are having
    difficulties expressing the requirements on the system needed to support the
    new or changed business process, or have difficulty separating what the new
    system will do as opposed to what the new business process will do.<br>
    <br>
    Defining the business context starts with <a href="../workflow/busmodel/wfs_idbm.htm">Workflow
    Detail: Identify Business Processes</a>. Prioritize those business processes
    that affects the system being built, and detail those according to <a href="../workflow/busmodel/wfs_dbuc.htm">Workflow
    Detail: Refine Business Process Definitions</a>. <a href="../workflow/busmodel/wfs_fbom.htm">Workflow
    Detail: Design Business Process Realizations</a> and the <a href="../workflow/busmodel/wfs_dbom.htm">Workflow
    Details: Refine Roles and Responsibilities</a> shows how you further refine
    your understanding of the responsibilities that need to be carried out by
    the organization. In parallel with building the process realizations, you
    need to look at types of system sort, as described in <a href="../workflow/busmodel/wfs_prep.htm">Workflow
    Detail: Explore Process Automation</a>.&nbsp;
    <p>The degree of business engineering performed depends on the desired
    results. If the purpose of business engineering is merely to set context for
    the system, the effort should be restricted to the subset of the business
    which will be supported by the system to be developed. Further business
    engineering, while perhaps valuable for other reasons, tends to be
    de-focusing for the system development team.</td>

      project manager's assessment of the risk (because, for example, the system
      is unprecedented, the domain is new to the development team, or the
      requirements are still not well understood or are particularly onerous).
      If the risk is low, there may be need for little more than clarifications

      Detail: Refine the System Definition</a> and <a href="../workflow/requirem/wfs_mnch.htm">Workflow
      Detail: Manage Changing Requirements</a>, before a decision can be taken
      by the stakeholders to commit to development, and the elaboration phase
      can begin.
      <p>If the risks are judged to be high, then it may be necessary to do more
      exploration in this initial inception phase iteration, as described in the
      (optional) <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/wfs_archsyn.htm">Workflow Detail:

      Construct Architectural Proof-of-Concept</a>), with the objective of
      increasing confidence in the feasibility of the project.</p>
      <p>At the end of the initial inception iteration, the scope of the project
      and its associated risks are reevaluated to update the Business Case. Then
      the Iteration Plan for the next iteration is constructed; in parallel, the
      Software Development Plan and any of the artifacts it contains are
      updated, if this is warranted.</p>

<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The result of this initial iteration is a first cut at:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="../artifact/ar_vsion.htm">Artifact:
Vision</a> </li>
  <li> the <a href="../artifact/ar_bcase.htm">Artifact: Business Case</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the <a href="../artifact/ar_sdp.htm">Artifact
Software Development Plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of the project should be understood, and the stakeholders initiating the project should
have a good understanding of the project's ROI (return on investment), i.e. what is returned,
for what investment cost. Given this knowledge, a go/no go
decision can be taken.</p>
<h4>Subsequent Iterations In Inception</h4>
<p>In cases where the project involves new product roll-out or creation of new
technology, subsequent iterations may be needed to further define the scope of
the project, the risks and the benefits. This may involve further enhancing the
use-case model, business case, risk list, architectural proof-of-concept, or project and iteration plans.
Extension of the Inception phase may also be advisable in cases where both the
risk and the investment required are high, or where the problem domain is new or
the team inexperienced.</p><br>
