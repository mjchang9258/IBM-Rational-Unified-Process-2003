<rpw name="PresentationName">Sample Iteration Plan</rpw>: Elaboration Phase</h2>
<p>This is an example of a typical iteration schedule in the Elaboration Phase 
  of a project following the <b>Classic RUP configuration</b> or similar. This 
  illustration shows the relationship of the workflows in the iteration. It is 
  constructed from the Workflow Details as they would appear at that time. The 
  intent is to indicate dependencies and show where workflows occur in parallel. 
  The lengths of the bars in the chart (indicating duration) have no absolute 
  significance. For example, it is not intended to convey that Plan for Next Iteration 
  and Manage the Scope of the System must have the same duration. There is also 
  no intention to suggest the application of a uniform level of effort across 
  the duration of the workflows. An indication of the relative effort can be seen 
  in the <a href="../ovu_proc.htm">Process Overview</a>. You can navigate to the 
  corresponding Workflow Detail pages from each line of the chart by clicking 
  on the Workflow Detail name. This illustration was created from a <a href="../../prjtmpl/mgmt/mp_elabit.htm">Microsoft 
  Project Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Note that although this is a plan for a single iteration, not all Requirements 
  and Analysis and Design work performed during this iteration is intended for 
  Implementation and Test in this iteration. This explains why the relative effort, 
  within an iteration, for Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation and 
  Test, changes through the lifecycle. However, the Iteration Plan will dictate 
  what requirements are explored and refined and what components are designed, 
  even if they are intended for Implementation and Test in a later iteration.</p>

        In parallel with this effort, a team of <a href="../workers/wk_dsgnr.htm">Role:

<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The result of this initial iteration would be a first cut at the architecture, 
  consisting of fairly described architectural views (use-case view, logical view, 
  process view, deployment view, implementation view) and an executable architecture 
  prototype.</p>


<h4>Subsequent Iterations In Elaboration</h4>
<p>Subsequent iterations can be initiated to further enhance the understanding 
  of the architecture. This might imply a further enhancement of the design or 
  implementation model (that is, the realization of more use cases, in priority 
  order, of course). Whether this needs to take place depends on considerations 
  such as the complexity of the system and its architecture, associated risks, 
  and domain experience. 
<p>In each iteration the supporting environment is further refined. If the first 
  Elaboration iteration&nbsp; focused on preparing the environment for Analysis 
  &amp; Design, and Implementation, then the second iteration may focus on preparing 
  the test environment. Preparing the test environment includes configuring the 
  test process, and writing that part of the development case, preparing templates 
  and guidelines for test and setting up the test tools.</p>
