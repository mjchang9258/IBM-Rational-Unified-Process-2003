<rpw name="PresentationName">Sample Iteration Plan</rpw>: Transition Phase</h2>
<p>This illustration shows the relationship of the workflows in an iteration late 
  in the Transition Phase of a project following a <b>Classic RUP configuration 
  </b>or similar. If the Workflow Detail 'Close-Out Project' is invoked, then 
  this would be the final iteration. It is constructed from the Workflow Details 
  as they would appear at that time. The intent is to indicate dependencies and 
  show where workflows occur in parallel. The lengths of the bars in the chart 
  (indicating duration) have no absolute significance. For example, it is not 
  intended to convey that Refine the Architecture and Acceptance Test the Product 
  (at the development site) have the similar duration. There is also no intention 
  to suggest the application of a uniform level of effort across the duration 
  of the workflows. An indication of the relative effort can be seen in the<a href="../ovu_proc.htm"> 
  Process Overview</a>. You can navigate to the corresponding Workflow Detail 
  pages from each line of the chart by clicking on the Workflow Detail name. This 
  illustration was created from a <a href="../../prjtmpl/mgmt/mp_transit.htm">Microsoft 
  Project Plan</a>.</p>

      integration in the piecewise fashion used during construction because the
