<h1><b><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></b><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h1>
<p>The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a process framework that Rational Software 
  has refined over the years which has been widely used for all types of software 
  projects&#151;from small to large. Recently a growing number of &quot;agile&quot; 
  processes&#151;such as eXtreme Programming (XP), SCRUM, Feature-Driven Development 
  (FDD) and the Crystal Clear Methodology&#151;have recently been gaining recognition 
  as effective methods for building smaller systems. (See <a href="http://www.agilealliance.org">www.agilealliance.org</a> 
  for further information on the Agile Alliance.)</p>

<p>The following sections are intended to assist those project teams evaluating 
  some of the &quot;agile&quot; practices found in one of these methods to see 
  how they are addressed by the more complete <a href="../../../manuals/intro/im_keymc.htm">software 
  development process</a> defined by RUP. </p>
<h1><font size="5"><a name="Roadmap Overview">Overview</a><a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></font></h1>
      
<p>The agile community has synthesized a number of &quot;best practices&quot; 
  that are especially applicable to small, co-located project teams. Although 
  RUP is targeted to project teams of any size, it can be successfully applied 
  to small projects. In general, RUP and the processes 
  of the Agile community have a similar view of the key best practices required 
  to develop quality software&#151;for example, applying iterative development 
  and focusing on the end users. </p>
<p>The following sections explain how to apply some of the &quot;best practices&quot; 
  identified in the agile community to RUP-based projects that would like to benefit 
  from some of these practices. In this case, the focus will be specifically on 
  those practices presented by the eXtreme Programming (XP) methodology. (For 
  more information on XP, please refer to the website: <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">http://www.extremeprogramming.org</a>.)<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="XPPractices"></a>XP Practices<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>XP includes four basic &quot;activities&quot; (coding, testing, listening, 
  and designing), which are actually more closely aligned with RUP <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_discipline.htm">disciplines</a>. 
  These XP activities are performed using a set of practices that require the 
  performance of additional activities, which map to some of the other disciplines 
  in the RUP. XP's practices, according to <a href="#References"><i>Extreme 
  Programming Explained</i></a>, are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The planning game</b>: Quickly determine the scope of the next release 
    by combining business priorities and technical estimates. As reality overtakes 
    the plan, update the plan.</li>
  <li><b>Small releases</b>: Put a simple system into production quickly, then 
    release new versions on a very short cycle.</li>
  <li><b>Metaphor</b>: Guide all development with a simple shared story of how 
    the whole system works.</li>
  <li><b>Simple design</b>: The system should be designed as simply as possible 
    at any given moment. Extra complexity is removed as soon as it is discovered.</li>
  <li><b>Testing</b>: Programmers continually write unit tests, which must run 
    flawlessly for development to continue. Customers write tests demonstrating 
    that features are finished.</li>
  <li><b>Refactoring</b>: Programmers restructure the system without changing 
    its behavior to remove duplication, improve communication, simplify, or add 
    flexibility.</li>
  <li><b>Pair programming</b>: All production code is written with two programmers 
    at one machine.</li>
  <li><b>Collective ownership</b>: Anyone can change any code anywhere in the 
    system at any time.</li>
  <li><b>Continuous integration</b>: Integrate and build the system many times 
    a day, every time a task is completed.</li>
  <li><b>40-hour week</b>: Work no more than 40 hours a week as a rule. Never 
    work overtime a second week in a row.</li>
  <li><b>On-site customer</b>: Include a real, live user on the team, available 
    full-time to answer questions.</li>
  <li><b>Coding standards</b>: Programmers write all code in accordance with rules 
    emphasizing communication through the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities performed as a result of the &quot;planning game&quot; practice, 
  for example, will mainly map to the RUP's project management discipline. But 
  some RUP topics, such as business modeling and the deployment of the released 
  software, are outside the scope of XP. Requirements elicitation is largely outside 
  the scope of XP, since the customer defines and provides the requirements. Also, 
  because of simpler development projects it addresses, XP can deal very lightly 
  with the issues the RUP covers in detail in the configuration and change management 
  discipline and the environment discipline.</p>
<h3><a name="XP2RUPPractices"></a>XP Practices Compatible with RUP<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In the disciplines in which XP and the RUP overlap, the following practices 
  described in XP could be&#151;and in some cases already are&#151;employed in 
  the RUP:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The planning game</b>: The XP guideance on planning could be used to 
    achieve many of the objectives shown in the Project Management discipline 
    of RUP for a very small project. This is especially useful for low-formality 
    projects that are not required to produce formal intermediate project management 
    artifacts.</li>
  <li><b>Test-first design and refactoring</b>: These are good techniques that 
    can be applied in the RUP's implementation discipline. XP's testing practice, 
    which requires test-first design, is in particular an excellent way to clarify 
    requirements at a detailed level. As we'll see in the next section, refactoring 
    may not scale well for larger systems. </li>
  <li><b>Continuous integration</b>: The RUP supports this practice through builds 
    at the subsystem and system levels (within an iteration). Unit-tested components 
    are integrated and tested in the emerging system context.</li>
  <li><b>On-site customer</b>: Many of the RUP's activities would benefit greatly 
    from having a customer on-site as a team member, which can reduce the number 
    of intermediate deliverables needed&#151;particularly documents. As its preferred 
    medium of customer-developer communication, XP stresses conversation, which 
    relies on continuity and familiarity to succeed; however, when a system&#151;even 
    a small one&#151;has to be transitioned, more than conversation will be needed. 
    XP allows for this as something of an afterthought with, for example, design 
    documents at the end of a project. While it doesn't prohibit producing documents 
    or other artifacts, XP says you should produce only those you really need. 
    The RUP agrees, but it goes on to describe what you might need when continuity 
    and familiarity are not ideal.</li>
  <li><b>Coding standards</b>: The RUP has an artifact&#151;programming guidelines&#151;that 
    would almost always be regarded as mandatory. (Most project risk profiles, 
    being a major driver of tailoring, would make it so.)</li>
  <li><b>Forty-hour week</b>: As in XP, the RUP suggests that working overtime 
    should not be a chronic condition. XP does not suggest a hard 40-hour limit, 
    recognizing different tolerances for work time. Software engineers are notorious 
    for working long hours without extra reward&#151;just for the satisfaction 
    of seeing something completed&#151;and managers need not necessarily put an 
    arbitrary stop to that. What managers should never do is exploit this practice 
    or impose it. They should always be collecting metrics on hours actually worked, 
    even if uncompensated. If the log of hours worked by anyone seems high over 
    an extended period, this certainly should be investigated; however, these 
    are issues to be resolved in the circumstances in which they arise, between 
    the manager and the individual, recognizing any concerns the rest of the team 
    might have. Forty hours is only a guide&#151;but a strong one.</li>
  <li><b>Pair programming</b>: XP claims that pair programming is beneficial to 
    code quality, and that once this skill is acquired it becomes more enjoyable. 
    The RUP doesn't describe the mechanics of code production at such a fine-grained 
    level, although it would certainly be possible to use pair programming in 
    a RUP-based process. Some information on pair programming&#151;as well as 
    test-first design and refactoring&#151;is now provided with the RUP, in the 
    form of white papers. Obviously, it is not a requirement to use any of these 
    practices in the RUP, however in a team environment, with a culture of open 
    communication, we would hazard a guess that the benefits of pair programming 
    (in terms of effect on total lifecycle costs) would be hard to discern. People 
    will come together to discuss and solve problems quite naturally in a team 
    that's working well, without being obliged to do so. </li>
</ul>
<p>The suggestion that good process has to be enforced at the &quot;micro&quot; 
  level is often unpalatable and may not fit some corporate cultures. Strict enforcement, 
  therefore, is not advocated by RUP. However, in some circumstances, working 
  in pairs&#151;and some of the other team-based practices advocated by XP&#151;is 
  obviously advantageous, as each team member can help the other along; for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in the early days of team formation, as people are getting acquainted,</li>
  <li>in teams inexperienced in some new technology,</li>
  <li>in teams with a mix of experienced staff and novices.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="XPNoScale"></a>XP Practices That Don't Scale Well<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The following XP practices don't scale well for larger systems (nor does XP 
  claim they do), so we would make their use subject to this proviso in the RUP. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Metaphor</b>: For larger, complex systems, architecture as metaphor is 
    simply not enough. The RUP provides a much richer description framework for 
    architecture that isn't just&#151;as <a href="#References"><i>Extreme Programming 
    Explained</i></a> describes it&#151;&quot;big boxes and connections.&quot; 
    Even in the XP community, metaphor has more recently been deprecated. It is 
    no longer one of the practices in XP (until they can figure out how to describe 
    it well&#151;maybe a metaphor would help them).</li>
  <li><b>Collective Ownership</b>: It's useful if the members of a team responsible 
    for a small system or a subsystem are familiar with all of its code. But whether 
    you want to have all team members equally empowered to make changes anywhere 
    should depend on the complexity of the code. It will often be faster (and 
    safer) to have a fix made by the individual (or pair) currently working on 
    the relevant code segment. Familiarity with even the best-written code, particularly 
    if it's algorithmically complex, diminishes rapidly over time.</li>
  <li><b>Refactoring</b>: In a large system, frequent refactoring is no substitute 
    for a lack of architecture. <a href="#References"><i>Extreme Programming 
    Explained</i></a> says, &quot;XP's design strategy resembles a hill-climbing 
    algorithm. You get a simple design, then you make it a little more complex, 
    then a little simpler, then a little more complex. The problem with hill-climbing 
    algorithms is reaching local optima, where no small change can improve the 
    situation, but a large change could.&quot; In the RUP, architecture provides 
    the view and access to the &quot;big hill,&quot; to make a large, complex 
    system tractable.</li>
  <li><b>Small Releases</b>: The rate at which a customer can accept and deploy 
    new releases will depend on many factors, typically including the size of 
    the system, which is usually correlated with business impact. A two-month 
    cycle may be far too short for some types of system; the logistics of deployment 
    may prohibit it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="XPCaution"></a>XP Practice Requiring Caution<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, an XP practice that at first glance sounds potentially usable in the 
  RUP&#151;Simple Design&#151;needs some elaboration and caution when applied 
  generally.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple Design</b><br>
    XP is very much functionality driven: user stories are selected, decomposed 
    into tasks, and then implemented. According to <a href="#References"><i>Extreme 
    Programming Explained</i></a>, the right design for the software at any given 
    time is the one that runs all the tests, has no duplicated logic, states every 
    intention important to the programmers, and has the fewest possible classes 
    and methods. XP doesn't believe in adding anything that isn't needed to deliver 
    business value to the customer. 
    <p>There's a problem here, akin to the problem of local optimizations, in 
      dealing with what the RUP calls &quot;nonfunctional&quot; requirements. 
      These requirements also deliver business value to the customer, but they're 
      more difficult to express as stories. Some of what XP calls constraints 
      fall into this category. The RUP doesn't advocate designing for more than 
      is required in any kind of speculative way, either, but it does advocate 
      designing with an architectural model in mind-that model being one of the 
      keys to meeting nonfunctional requirements.</p>
    <p>So, the RUP agrees with XP that the &quot;simple design&quot; should include 
      running all the tests, but with the rider that this includes tests that 
      demonstrate that the software will meet the nonfunctional requirements. 
      Again, this only looms as a major issue as system size and complexity increase, 
      or when the architecture is unprecedented or the nonfunctional requirements 
      onerous. For example, the need for marshalling data (to operate in a heterogeneous 
      distributed environment) seems to make code overly complex, but it will 
      still be required throughout the program.</p>

<p>When we tailor the RUP for a small project and reduce the <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_artifact.htm">artifact</a> 
  requirements accordingly, how does this compare to the equivalent of artifacts 
  in an XP project? Looking at the <a href="../../../examples/devcase_sp/dc_index.htm">example 
  development case for small projects</a> in the RUP, we see a sample RUP configuration 
  has been configured to produce fewer artifacts (as shown in Table 1).</p>

  Support Material.</a><br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Activities"></a>Activities<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>The RUP defines an <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_activity.htm">activity</a> 
  as work performed by a <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_role.htm">role</a>&#151;either 
  using and transforming input artifacts or producing new and changed output artifacts. 
  RUP goes on to enumerate these activities and categorize them according to the 
  RUP <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_discipline.htm">disciplines</a>. These disciplines 
  include: business modeling, requirements, analysis and design, deployment, and 
  project management (among others).</p>
<p>Activities are time-related through the artifacts they produce and consume: 
  an activity can logically begin when its inputs are available (and in an appropriately 
  mature state). This means that producer-consumer activity pairs can overlap 
  in time, if the artifact state permits; they need not be rigidly sequenced. 
  Activities are intended to give strong guidance on how an artifact should be 
  produced, and they may also be used to help the project manager with planning.</p>
<p>Woven through the RUP as it's described in terms of lifecycle, artifacts, and 
  activities are &quot;best practices&quot;: software engineering principles proven 
  to yield quality software built to predictable schedule and budget. The RUP, 
  through its activities (and their associated artifacts) supports and realizes 
  these best practices - they are themes running through the RUP. Note that XP 
  uses the notion of &quot;practices&quot; as well, but as we shall see, there 
  is not an exact alignment with RUP's concept of best practice.</p>
<p>XP presents an engagingly simple view of software development as having four 
  basic activities&#151;coding, testing, listening, and designing&#151;which are 
  to be enabled and structured according to some supporting practices (as discussed 
  in Extreme Programming Explained, Chapter 9). Actually, as noted earlier, XP's 
  activities are closer in scope to the RUP's disciplines than to the RUP's activities, 
  and much of what happens on an XP project (in addition to its four basic activities) 
  will come from the elaboration and application of its practices.</p>
<p>So, there is an XP equivalent of the RUP's activities, but XP's &quot;activities&quot; 
  aren't formally identified or described as such. For example, looking at Chapter 
  4, &quot;User Stories,&quot; in <a href="#References"><i>Extreme Programming 
  Installed</i></a>, you'll find the heading, &quot;Define requirements with stories, 
  written on cards,&quot; and throughout the chapter there's a mixture of process 
  description and guidance on what user stories are, and how (and by whom) they 
  should be produced. And it goes on that way; in the various sections of the 
  <a href="#References">XP books</a> (under headings that are a mixture of artifact-focused 
  and activity-focused), both &quot;things produced&quot; and &quot;things done&quot; 
  are described, to varying degrees of prescription and detail.</p>
<p> RUP's apparently high degree of prescription results from its completeness 
  and greater formality in its treatment of activities and their inputs and outputs. 
  XP does not lack prescription but, perhaps in its attempt to remain lightweight, 
  the formality and detail are simply omitted. Lack of specificity is neither 
  a strength nor a weakness, but the lack of detailed information in XP should 
  not be confused with simplicity. Not having details may be fine for more experienced 
  developers, but in many cases, more details are a great help for new team members, 
  and team members that are still getting up to speed with the team's approach 
  to software development. </p>
<p>With Activities, just as with Artifacts, it is important to keep focus on what 
  we are trying to achieve. Carrying out an activity blindly is never a good practice. 
  Activities and associated guidelines are there to look at when you need them 
  to achieve your objectives, but should not be used as an excuse for not having 
  to figure out what you are trying to achieve. This spirit is well articulated 
  in XP, and we believe it should be applied by every user of RUP<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Roles"></a>Roles<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>In the RUP, <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_activity.htm">activities</a> are said 
  to be performed by <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_role.htm">roles</a> (or, more 
  precisely, by individuals or groups playing roles). Roles also have responsibility 
  for particular <a href="../../../manuals/intro/kc_artifact.htm">artifacts</a>; the 
  responsible role will usually create the artifact and ensure that any changes 
  made by other roles (if allowed at all) don't break the artifact. An individual 
  or group of people may perform just one role or several roles. A role doesn't 
  have to be mapped to a only a single position or &quot;slot&quot; in an organization.</p>
<p><i><a href="#References">Extreme Programming Explained</a></i> identifies 
  seven roles applicable to XP&#151;Programmer, Customer, Tester, Tracker, Coach, 
  Consultant, and Big Boss&#151;and describes their responsibilities and the competencies 
  required of the people who will perform them. References are made to these roles 
  in some of the other <a href="#References"><i>XP books</i></a> as well. The 
  difference in the number of roles in XP and the RUP is easy to explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XP doesn't cover all of the RUP disciplines.</li>
  <li>XP roles are more comparable to positions within an organization (possibly 
    with multiple responsibilities) than to RUP roles. For example, XP's Programmer 
    actually performs multiple RUP roles&#151;Implementer, Code Reviewer, and 
    Integrator&#151;which require slightly different competencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="RUPRolesSmallProject"></a>XP and RUP Roles on a Small Project<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>When RUP roles are mapped to a small project, the number of XP-like roles that 
  they correspond to is reduced considerably in that the number of positions, 
  or job titles, is 5. Table 3 (drawn from the RUP) shows this mapping with the 
  corresponding XP Role.<br>

  <h3 align="left"><a name="CompareXP2RUP"></a>Using XP Practices with RUP<a href="#Top"><img alt="To top of page" border="0" src="../../../images/top.gif" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
  <p align="left">The RUP is a process framework from which particular processes 
    can be configured and then instantiated. The RUP must be configured&#151;this 
    is a required step defined in the RUP itself. Strictly speaking then, we should 
    compare a tailored version of the RUP with XP&#151;that is, with the RUP tailored 
    to the project characteristics that XP explicitly establishes (and those that 
    can be inferred). Such a tailored RUP process could accommodate many of XP's 
    practices (such as pair programming, test-first design and refactoring), but 
    it still wouldn't be identical to XP because of RUP's emphasis on the importance 
    of architecture, abstraction (in modeling), and risk, and its different structure 
    in time (phases and iterations).</p>
  <p align="left"> XP is intentionally directed at implementing a lightweight 
    process for small projects. In doing so, it also includes descriptions (at 
    least in the books) that are not fully elaborated. In an XP implementation 
    there will always be things that will need to be discovered, invented, or 
    defined on the fly. The RUP will accommodate projects that both fit and are 
    beyond the scope of XP in scale and kind. As this roadmap shows, RUP is actually 
    quite compatible with most of the practices described in the XP literature. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Keep in mind that essence of XP is its focus on organization, 
    people, and culture. This is important in all projects and is certainly applicable 
    to those projects using RUP. Small projects could benefit greatly by using 
    these practices together.</p>
