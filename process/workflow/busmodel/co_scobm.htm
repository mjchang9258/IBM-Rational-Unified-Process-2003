<h2 class="banner">Concepts:&nbsp;<rpw name="PresentationName">Scope of Business 
  Modeling</rpw><a name="XE_business_modeling__scope"></a></h2>
<p>A business-modeling effort can have different scopes depending on context and
need. Six such scenarios are listed below.
<h5>Scenario #1&#151;Organization Chart</h5>
<p>You may want to build a simple map of the organization and its processes to get a better understanding of what the requirements are on the
application you are building. In this case, business modeling is part of the
software-engineering project, primarily performed during the inception phase.
These types of efforts often start out as merely charting with no intent of
changing the organization, however, in reality, building and deploying a new
application always includes some level of <a href="../../glossary.htm#business_improvement">business
improvement</a>.</p>
<h5>Scenario #2&#151;Domain Modeling</h5>
<p>If you are building applications with the primary purpose of managing and presenting 
  information, such as an order management system or a banking system, you may 
  choose to build a model of that information at a business level, without considering 
  the workflows of the business. This is referred to as domain modeling. See <a href="wfs_dm.htm">Workflow 
  Detail: Develop a Domain Model</a>. Typically, domain modeling is part of the 
  software-engineering project, and is performed during the inception and elaboration 
  phases of the project. </p>
<h5>Scenario #3&#151;One Business Many Systems</h5>
<p>If you are building a large system, or a family of applications, you may have 
  one business-modeling effort that will serve as input to several software-engineering 
  projects. The business models help you find functional requirements, and they 
  serve as input to building the architecture of the application family. See <a href="../../modguide/md_bmtse.htm">Guidelines: 
  Going from Business Models to systems</a>. The business-modeling effort is, 
  in this case, often treated as a project on its own. </p>
<h5>Scenario #4&#151;Generic Business Model</h5>
<p>If you are building an application that will be used by several organizations&#151;for 
  example, a sales support application or a billing application<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">&#151;</span>it can be useful to go through a business-modeling 
  effort to align the organizations as to how they do their business to avoid 
  requirements that are too complex for the system (<a href="../../glossary.htm#business_improvement">business 
  improvement</a>). If aligning the organizations is not an option, however, a 
  business-modeling effort can help you understand and manage differences in how 
  the organizations will use the application and will make it easier to determine 
  which application functionality should be prioritized. </p>
<h5>Scenario #5&#151;New Business</h5>
<p>If an organization has decided to start a completely new line of business (<a href="../../glossary.htm#business_creation">business 
  creation</a>), and will build information systems to support it, a business-modeling 
  effort needs to be performed. In this case, the purpose of business modeling 
  is not only to find requirements on systems, but also to determine the feasibility 
  of the new line of business. The business-modeling effort is, in this case, 
  often treated as a project on its own. </p>
<h5>Scenario #6&#151;Revamp</h5>
<p>If an organization has decided to completely revamp their way of doing business 
  (<a href="../../glossary.htm#business_reengineering">business reengineering</a>), 
  business modeling is often one or several projects in its own right. Typically, 
  business reengineering is done in several stages: envision the new business, 
  reverse-engineer the existing business, forward-engineer the new business, and 
  install the new business.</p>
