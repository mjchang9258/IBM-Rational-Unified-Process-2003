<h3><a name="Small and Large Organizations">Small and Large Organizations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The differences between a small and a large organization lie in the broader
spectrum of products, often within several totally different product families.
Generally the higher the complexity of products, the more distributed the
organization and the market. This results in a larger number of more complex
business use cases, involving many more employees with more specialized tasks.</p>
<p>The techniques proposed here can be applied independently or in combination.</p>
<h3><a name="High-Level and Detailed Business Use Cases">High-Level and Detailed
Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A company’s executive management, as well as its process owners, are
interested in their company’s business models—the management must work with
the company’s strategic objectives, whereas the process owners and leaders
need a detailed picture of how their process should be performed.</p>
<p>If the differences between the executives’ and the process owners’ views of 
  the organization are too great, you could satisfy their needs by developing 
  two different, yet related, sets of business use cases. One model, for the executives, 
  would contain a set of high-level business use cases that showed the intent 
  and purpose of the organization. The other model, for the process owners, would 
  contain a detailed set of use cases that helped clarify how the organization 
  needs to function internally. For each high-level business use case, you could 
  define one, or several, detailed business use cases representing the same activities 
  in the organization. For example, you could start with the primary business 
  actor, detail the results and services he or she is interested in, or even specialize 
  the business actor itself, then develop a separate business use case for each 
  detailed area.</p>
<p>If you want to engineer your organization one business use case at a time, 
  you can apply this technique incrementally. First make a high-level use-case 
  model of the entire business and rank the business use cases in an overview, 
  then identify one or several detailed business use cases for the highest ranked, 
  high-level business use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a one-to-one relationship between a high-level business use case and
its set of detailed business use cases. The relationships between business use
cases of the two categories are represented as &laquo;refinement&raquo; relationships, a
stereotype of dependency. A high-level business use case, and the group of
detailed business use cases it represents, can be presented in the same diagram.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/large1.gif" width="517" height="570"></p>
<p align="left" class="picturetext">High-level business use cases and detailed 
  business use cases. The detailed business use cases have been identified by

<h3><a name="Super-Ordinate and Subordinate Models">Superordinate and
Subordinate Models</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The technique for modeling business use cases presented so far is most easily
applied to companies that have a single business area and whose business
activities are concentrated geographically at one location. For larger companies distributed over several locations, it may be
necessary to scale up the technique.</p>
<p>Therefore, to model companies built of independent-yet-cooperating parts, you 
  can build one superordinate Business Use-Case Model that describes the whole 
  business, followed by one subordinate Business Use-Case Model for each business 
  area. <a href="../../artifact/ar_orgu.htm">Business systems</a> can be used 
  to define the various areas of responsibility, different physical locations, 
  or interacting parts of the business.</p>
<p>To explore realizations of the superordinate business use cases, you can identify 
  business systems and show how they collaborate to perform the workflow. At this 
  level, a business system corresponds to a business area. Collaborations between 
  the business systems can be explicitly defined and clarified using interfaces 
  at a business level. These &quot;interfaces&quot; describe the set of responsibilities 
  provided by the business system.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/large2.gif" width="592" height="443"></p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext">Superordinate and subordinate models of an
organization</p>
<p align="center" class="picturetext"><img border="0" src="images/large4.gif" width="660" height="273"></p>
<p>In this example, we see the superordinate business use case Request Proposal 
  being refined into the subordinate business use cases Request Proposal, Plan 
  and Estimate Project, and Estimate Resource Costs at the business system level. 
  The superordinate business use case Supply Resources has been refined into the 
  subordinate business use cases Determine Resource Needs and Purchase Raw Materials 
  at the business system level.</p>
<p>Each business system can then be treated as an organization of its own, fulfilling 
  the interfaces defined in the superordinate Business Analysis Model.</p>
<h3><a name="Layered Business Models">Layered Business Models</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In software engineering, a technique used to master the complexity of very 
  large systems is called layering. The idea behind this technique is to separate 
  the application-specific parts from the more general parts of the system, so 
  that the program units and program services can be reused. When structuring 
  organizations, the same principles are often naturally applied. For example, 
  in the bottom layer you find resources that provide general services; somewhere 
  in the middle layer you often find resources that support business-specific 
  activities; and in the top layer you find business area-specific or product-specific 
  specialists, Research and Development, and sales force activities. Core business 
  use cases use resources from all layers.</p>
<p>Therefore, layering is not a question of qualifications or seniority, but of uniqueness and importance in relation to the company’s
business ideas. A task handled by a business worker from the general skill layer
could be as qualified as any other. The work in core business use
cases and supporting business use cases where business-specific information
systems, production lines, and other types of business infrastructure are
developed, may require equally business-specific skills from the same layered
organization.</p>
<p><a href="../../modguide/md_orgun.htm">Guidelines: Business System</a> contains an example of business
systems and their interfaces. While this example does not explicitly illustrate layers, the business systems
in this example are layered implicitly.</p>
<p>For an explanation of the terms &quot;core,&quot; &quot;supporting,&quot; and 
  &quot;management business use case,&quot; see <a href="../../modguide/md_bucm.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Use Case Model</a>—specifically the section on different categories 
  of business use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Business Use Cases and Classes in a Layered Model&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Structuring the organization into layers does not change the business use case, 
  because the same results still need to be produced. It does, however, change 
  the business use-case realizations.</p>
<p>Compared to a non-layered Business Analysis Model, a layered Business Analysis 
  Model should be developed with two recommended restrictions in mind: 
<ul>
  <li>A business worker in a certain layer never makes contact with a business
    worker or manipulates a business entity of a higher layer, except on
    explicit request from someone in the higher layer. Similarly, business
    events from higher layers should not be propagated to lower layers.
  <li>A business worker has responsibilities only within his or her own layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without these restrictions, a layered structure quickly degenerates. Note
that these restrictions apply to the case where the most general parts of the
business are found in lower layers, while the most specific (regarding a
particular market segment) are found in the upper layers. Organization charts
tend to be the other way around—from general at the top to specific at the
bottom.</p>
<p>When identifying business workers and assigning activities to them, the skills 
  needed in order to perform an activity needs to be understood. A business worker 
  from the layer that organizes resources for those particular skills must perform 
  an activity that by its nature requires a particular skill. Instead of having 
  as few business workers as possible, which is the normal rule of thumb when 
  designing a business use case, you should now have as few business workers as 
  possible—with as wide responsibilities as possible—in each layer.</p>
<p>Workflows, business workers, business entities, and business events in lower 
  layers should be designed with generality in mind to provide services shaped 
  for reuse in several areas. Business workers and business entities can be organized 
  into business systems according to their business specificity. Business systems 
  that include the most general competencies and phenomena are found in the bottom 
  layer; while the most company-specific business systems are found in the top 
  layer.</p>
<h3><a name="Core Business Use Cases versus Supporting Business Use Cases">Core 
  Business Use Cases vs. Supporting Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Business use-case realizations will, to differing degrees, engage business 
  workers from different layers. Business use-case realizations with a high degree 
  of top-layer involvement (highly specific) set the profile of the company, implement 
  the business idea and function as the profit centers. These correspond to core 
  business use cases and supporting business use cases to provide core business 
  use cases with essential, business-area-specific infrastructure.</p>
<p>Business use-case realizations in lower layers, without top layer business 
  workers, provide the general services required to keep the company running. 
  They can be abstract and define workflows performed as parts of other business 
  use cases—for example, billing activities that conclude a sales business use 
  case. They can also be concrete, executing on their own and performing activities 
  that do not need business area-specific competence, like bookkeeping. These 
  normally correspond to supporting business use cases.</p>
<p>A layered structure reflects those kinds of skills that are key to the business 
  ideas, whether needed in core business use cases or supporting business use 
  cases, as well as those skills that are less specific. This could be a good 
  starting point for systematically analyzing the company's available resources.</p>
<h3><a name="Models of the Entire Organization">Models of the Entire
Organization</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In many cases, you are interested onlyin detailed information about one or 
  a few of your business processes. However, to provide context, it can be practical 
  to identify the complete set of business process and briefly describe each of 
  them. This results in a model that includes core business use cases, supporting 
  business use cases, and management business use cases. See the section on different 
  categories of business use cases in <a href="../../modguide/md_bucm.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Use Case Model</a>.</p>
<p>Supporting business use cases—such as core business use cases, business-specific 
  information systems, computer networks, and premises—are responsible for the 
  development and maintenance of a company’s infrastructure, among others. From 
  the modeling perspective, there are no real differences between core business 
  use cases and supporting business use cases. Both types of business use cases 
  should have the same requirements of usability and effectiveness. To perform 
  successfully, both kinds of business use cases might require the same types 
  of resource.</p>
<p>A supporting business use case in one organization—for example a software development 
  business use case—might be a core business use case in another. The major difference 
  is for whom the business use cases work. At the request of a business owner, 
  the supporting business use cases develop the business in cooperation with the 
  affected business use case owners and operators. In a model of the entire business, 
  a typical business actor would be the Board. When the modeling is delimited 
  to the supporting business use cases only, typical business actors are Business 
  Use-Case Owner and Business Use-Case Operator.</p>
<p>Management business use cases, on the other hand, are responsible for managing 
  the business; that is, for running and developing the other business use cases 
  according to directives from the owner in order to initiate and supervise core 
  business use cases and supporting business use cases according to directives 
  from the owner. The Business Analysis Model describes how executives, resource 
  owners, business use-case owners, business-use case leaders, and business use-case 
  operators need to cooperate. Typical business actors are the Owner or the Board.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/large3.gif" width="592" height="501"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A model of an entire organization</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, many minor tasks must be taken care of, such 
  as keeping the computer network running, answering the phone, and cleaning the 
  coffee machine. These tasks, however, are not part of a defined business use 
  case. For example, if you intend to be certified according to the ISO 9000 Standard, 
  these activities need to be included in the model as well. A straightforward 
  approach is provided by this rule of thumb: If it is a full-time job, assign 
  the activity to a specific business worker. If it is less than a full-time job, 
  assign the activity to an existing business worker with the right skill requirements 
  without trying to include it in any business use case.</p>
