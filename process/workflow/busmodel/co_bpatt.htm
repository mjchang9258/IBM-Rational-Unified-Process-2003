<p>We define a business pattern as generalized solutions that can be implemented
and applied in a problem situation (a context), and thereby eliminate one or
more of the inherent problems. Patterns can be considered prototypes for
production. [<a href="../../referenc.htm#ERI00">ERI00</a>]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patterns are part of how you define your business architecture:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>They reflect common solutions to common problems.</li>
  <li>Patterns help maintain an architectural style throughout the organization.</li>
  <li>They are a simple way of capturing experiences.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We present a few patterns that can be useful as a baseline:&nbsp;</p>

    evaluation pattern</a></li>

  <li>

</ul>
<p>All of these patterns are based on the extensive pattern collection in [<a href="../../referenc.htm#ERI00">ERI00</a>].&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Context</b>: This pattern is a sibling to the process
feedback pattern. It reflects a need to plan for more strategic and long-term
investments when improving a process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Problem</b>: The process evaluation pattern can be
applied to all situations where the business process results must be evaluated
to provide a competitive edge. Manufacturing, marketing, and sales processes are
examples of the different business processes that must be evaluated each time
they are executed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Solution</b>: A solution to this problem is to have an
evaluation process in place that continuously monitors and suggests
improvements, both long-term and short term, to a business process. <o:p>

to provide a competitive edge. Manufacturing, marketing, and sales processes are
examples of the different business processes that must be evaluated each time

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Problem</b>: A process starts with an input and ends
with an output. The process uses and consumes resources to create and refine
other resources that become the output. A process also has a certain goal to
achieve, which can be expressed in the number of resources that are output from
the process. If resources are not used effectively, it may become too expensive
to produce the outputs of the process, which would enable competitors to gain
market shares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Solution</b>: A solution to this problem is to measure
the effectiveness of the process, and at each initiation of a new instance of
the process, perform a few steps to evaluate how the process can be improved the
next time. <o:p>

<h3><a name="Business Event-Result History Pattern">Business Event-Result
History Pattern</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Context</b>: The business event-result history pattern
is suitable for problem domains where you need to maintain a history of business
events and their results. It is most often used to model financial systems and
enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Problem</b>: The business event-result history pattern
is use to track significant business events and then to connect these events to
their results. Capturing the different business events, along with their results&#151;such
as decisions, contracts, statements, or products&#151;helps you make better
business decisions. The goal of this pattern is to enable you to keep a record
of all important business events, which are typically described with attributes
such as description, purpose, and result.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b>Solution</b>: Using the business event-results history
pattern ensures that models produced to track important business events and
their causes are extensible. Extensible means that new kinds of events and
causes can be added at a later date to the same overall structure. Using this
pattern makes it possible to record business events and, at a later point in
time, to analyze these events and draw conclusions. These conclusions typically
lead to activities or decisions in the business, such as to discontinue a
relationship with a customer or vendor because of poor payment history. If no
record of business events is maintained, no history is available to learn from
and the same mistakes may be repeated over and over again. One potential problem
with this pattern is when too many low-level business events are recorded, the
amount of detail makes the record hard to analyze and evaluate. Events should be
defined so they’re easy to understand in a business context; for example,
order placed, product delivered, invoice paid, and so on. <o:p>

<p><b>List of participants:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Business Event&#151;This business entity describes significant occurrences to
the business. Examples of attributes to a Business Event could be date,
priority, description, and type. Common types are delivery, contract signing,
and purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product&#151;This business entity represents the deliverables. Products can be
abstract objects, such as a service, business effort or market share or physical
objects such as software and hardware. Common attributes are identifier and
name. Common types of products are computer program, support, consultation, and
installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Party&#151;This business entity may represent either individuals or companies.
The parties play a role in the context of a Contract. Typical roles are seller
and buyer. Party typically has the attributes name and address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contract&#151;This business entity represents a deal or a decision. The Contract
defines the circumstances of a delivery, where the delivery is a Product. The
Contract is usually between a seller and a buyer, but it can also be between
other parties. Common attributes are description, date and until-date. Contracts
can be associated with each other; for example, one contract can be
complimentary to another contract. This is also shown with the recursive
association. Examples of types of contracts are skeleton contract or lease
contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statement&#151;A Statement expresses a Contract. A Statement can express many
contracts and a contract can be stated many times. Typical attributes are
description and date. Statements can also be associated with each other. This is
shown with the recursive association. Examples of types of statements are
written statements and verbal statements. </o:p><o:p>
