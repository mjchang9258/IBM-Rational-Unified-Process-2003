<b><a href="../../artifact/ar_crqst.htm">Change Request</a> (<a name="CR">CR</a>)
– </b>A formally submitted artifact that is used to track all <a href="../../artifact/ar_stnds.htm">stakeholder
requests</a> (including new features, enhancement requests, defects, changed
requirements, etc.) along with related status information throughout the project
lifecycle. All change history will be maintained with the Change Request,
including all state changes along with dates and reasons for the change. This
information will be available for any repeat reviews and for final closing.</p>
<p>
<b>Change (or Configuration) Control Board (<a name="CCB">CCB</a>) </b>&#150; The
board that oversees the change process consisting of representatives from all
interested parties, including customers, developers, and users. In a small
project, a single team member, such as the project manager or software architect, may
play this role. In the Rational Unified Process, this is shown by the <a href="../../workers/wk_ccmgr.htm">Change
Control Manager role</a>.</p>
<p>
<b><a name="CCB Review Meeting">CCB Review Meeting</a></b> &#150; The function of
this meeting is to review <i>Submitted</i> Change Requests. An initial review of
the contents of the Change Request is done in the meeting to determine if it is
a valid request. If so, then a determination is made if the change is in or out
of scope for the current release(s), based on priority, schedule, resources,
level-of-effort, risk, severity and any other relevant criteria as determined by
the group. This meeting is typically held once per week. If the Change Request
volume increases substantially, or as the end of a release cycle approaches, the
meeting may be held as frequently as daily. Typical members of the CCB Review
Meeting are the Test Manager, Development Manager and a member of the Marketing
Department. Additional attendees may be deemed necessary by the members on an
&quot;as needed&quot; basis.</p>
<p>
<b>Change Request Submit Form</b> – This form is displayed when a Change
Request is being <i>Submitted</i> for the first time. Only the fields necessary
for the submitter to complete are displayed on the form.</p>
<p>
<b>Change Request Combined Form</b> – This form is displayed when you are
reviewing a Change Request that has already been submitted. It contains all the
fields necessary to describe the Change Request.</p>
<p>The following outline of the Change Request process describes the states and statuses of Change Requests
through their overall process, and who needs to be notified during the lifecycle
of the Change Request.
The general process associated with Change Requests is described in <a href="../../activity/ac_epcmp.htm">Activity:
Establish Change Control Process</a>.</p>
