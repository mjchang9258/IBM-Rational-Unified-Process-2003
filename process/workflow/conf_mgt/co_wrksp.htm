<h3><a name="Definition">Definition</a><a name="XE_workspaces__definition"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Workspaces refer to &#145;private&#146; areas where developers can implement 
  and test code in accordance with the project&#145;s adopted standards in relative 
  isolation from other developers. The Configuration Manager needs to create a 
  workspace environment for each developer on the project.</p>

<h3><a name="Explanation">Explanation</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A workspace provides each developer with a consistent, flexible, inexpensive, 
  and reproducible environment that selects and presents the appropriate version 
  of each file. The workspace needs to be able to provide fine-grained control 
  over both sharing and isolation. This is required because in most projects, 
  developers need to stay isolated from changes made by others; but at the same 
  time, they must be able to unit-test their changes with changes made by certain 
  other developers.</p>
<p>When performing maintenance on older releases, a developer needs to be able 
  to see older versions, binaries, documents, tests, tools, and other objects. 
  In this case the workspace serves as a &#145;time machine&#146;, making everything 
  in the environment, not just the sources, appear as it did in the past.</p>
<p>Each developer’s workspace needs to be isolated, for purposes of editing, compiling, 
  testing and debugging. However, the isolation of the workspace should be relative 
  and not absolute:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Others should be able to track a developers work, and selectively integrate 
    it into their own.</li>
  <li>Others should be able to shut out, until a subsequent integration period, 
    those changes that may prove destabilizing to their own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>A workspace can be completely private to an individual developer, or shared 
  among a team of developers over a network.</p>
<p>In addition to providing access to source versions, a workspace needs to provide 
  private (isolated) storage for files generated during software development:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Working (checked-out) versions of source files,</li>
  <li>Executables,</li>
  <li>Other workspace private objects – source code, test subdirectories, and 
    test data files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A workspace’s private storage would be typically located within a developer’s 
  home directory on a workstation. A workspace shared by a group of developers 
  might have its private storage area located on a central file server. However, 
  the actual location of the private storage is largely irrelevant. From the developer’s 
  point of view the workspace’s private storage should be appear to be fully integrated.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/co_wrksp.gif" width="434" height="311"></p>
<p class="picturetext">The figure above illustrates the notion of private and 
  integration workspaces in the overall context of the CM Cube.</p>

<h3><a name="WorkingConfigurations">Working Configurations</a><a name="XE_working_configurations"></a><a name="XE_workspaces__working_configurations"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Working configurations (workspace profiles) refer to particular subsystems 
  that make up a <b>working set</b> for the project. A working set is a list of 
  specific <b>versions</b> of subsystems that must be referenced, or modified, 
  to implement a piece of work. This list may represent the entire system or a 
  subset.</p>

<h3><a name="Views">Views</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A view provides access to a set of files in the project repository. Moreover, 
  a view provides access to an appropriate set of versions of those files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new development view may provide access to the most recent versions of 
    the files.</li>
  <li>Another new development view may provide access to the versions being used 
    by a team working on a new user interface for your product.</li>
  <li>A maintenance view may provide access to the versions of the files that 
    were used to build a given release of the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>A workspace, sometimes also called a view, allows developers to make and test 
  changes in private before sharing the modifications with the rest of the team. 
  There are two types of views:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Snapshot Views, and</li>
  <li>Dynamic Views.</li>
</ul>
<p>A<i> snapshot view</i> provides the developer with a stable, unchanging working 
  environment. It is analogous to a computer directory tree. A snapshot view is 
  populated with copies of the appropriate versions of files from one or more 
  project repositories. Some people use the term &quot;sandbox&quot; for such 
  a directory tree. When a developer wants to see changes made by other team members, 
  she updates her view. This style of working is characterized as a <b>pull</b> 
  model as it relies on actively pulling in the relevant information, rather than 
  it being immediately available through automatic refresh mechanisms.</p>
<p>A <i>dynamic view</i> is a virtual data structure as it appears to contain 
  all the development data. Dynamic views do not make local copies of files, but 
  rely on over the network immediate updating. Dynamic views may be the best choice 
  in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is limited client-side disk space</li>
  <li>You want to take advantage of derived object sharing</li>
  <li>The development team must work with the latest versions of the code. This 
    feature is particularly useful for integration that requires the latest version 
    of any given software.</li>
</ul>
