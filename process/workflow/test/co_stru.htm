<h2 class="banner">Concepts:&nbsp;<rpw name="PresentationName">Structure Testing</rpw></h2>

<p>The concept of structural testing is used in two main contexts. Although different 
  in nature, the root concept or idea behind structure testing is arguably the 
  same in both cases.</p>

<h4><a name="StructureofCode">Structure Testing of Code Internals</a></h4>
<p>The older reference and perhaps more established use of the term &quot;structure 
  testing&quot; relates to testing the internal structure of the software source 
  code. Most often, this form of structure testing is performed as a &quot;static&quot; 
  as opposed to a &quot;dynamic&quot; test, in that the software itself is not 
  executed to perform the test. Diagnostic tools parse the source code, looking 
  for structural errors and weaknesses, typically providing a list to enable subsequent 
  corrective action to be taken. This type of test and evaluation is conducted 
  by developers, rather than system testers.</p>

<h4><a name="StructureofWebSites">Structure Testing of Web Sites</a></h4>
<p>Web-based applications&#151those employing Internet application technology&#151are 
  increasingly more prevalent. This movement has been encouraged by the fact that 
  this software development and deployment method offers organizations the ability 
  to take advantage of several technology-enabled business benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Developed audience of customers, prospects, and business partners without 
    sending out a single piece of software or paper<i>.</i></b> Anyone with a 
    browser and access to the &quot;net&quot; (Internet or Intranet) can simply 
    point their browser to the published URL and immediately run the application.</li>
  <li><b>Centralized control and maintenance.</b> The &quot;thin-client/fat-server&quot; 
    model of Web-based applications places the application components and logic 
    on the Web server, which centralizes and simplifies control and maintenance. 
    This also enables developers to distribute the software automatically. Once 
    the application is on the server, it is immediately available for all users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this offers advantages to those who employ this technology, Web-based 
  applications increase the demands of testing. Testing these Web-based applications, 
  like their non-Web counterparts (client/server, legacy, and so forth), requires 
  testing to address the function and performance characteristics of the applications. 
  In addition, Web-based applications have the added need for tests that focus 
  on the structure of the application, ensuring it's well-formed and that all 
  links are valid.</p>

<p>Typically Web-based applications are constructed using a series of documents 
  (both HTML text documents and GIF/JPEG graphics) connected by many static links 
  and a few active, or program-controlled, links. These applications may also 
  include &quot;active content&quot;, such as forms, Java scripts, plug-in-rendered 
  content, or Java applications. Frequently this active content is used for output 
  only, such as for audio or video presentation. However, it may also be used 
  as a navigation aid, to help the user navigate the application (Web site). The 
  freeform nature of the Web-based applications (through its links) is a great 
  strength, but it's also a tremendous weakness because structural integrity can 
  be easily damaged.</p>

<p>Structure testing is implemented and executed to verify that
all links (static or active) are properly connected. These tests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Verifying that the proper content (text, graphics, and so on) for each 
    link is displayed.</b> Different types of links are used to reference target-content 
    in Web-based applications, such as bookmarks, hyperlinks to other target content 
    (in the same or different Web site), or hot spots. Each link needs to be verified 
    to ensure that the correct target-content is presented to the user.</li>
  <li><b>Ensuring there are no broken links.</b> Broken links are those links 
    for which the target content cannot be found. Links may be broken for many 
    reasons, including moving, removing, or renaming the target-content files. 
    Links may also be broken because of improper syntax use, including missing 
    slashes, colons, or letters.</li>
  <li><b>Verifying there is no orphaned content.</b> Orphaned content are those 
    files for which there is no &quot;inbound&quot; link in the current Web site; 
    that is, there is no way to access or present the content. Care must be taken 
    to investigate orphaned content to determine the cause:
    <ul>
      <li>Is it orphaned because it is truly no longer needed? </li>
      <li>Is it orphaned due to a broken link? </li>
      <li>Or is it accessed by a link external to the current Web site?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once determined, the appropriate action should be taken, such as remove the 
  content file, repair the broken link, or ignore the orphan, respectively.</p>
