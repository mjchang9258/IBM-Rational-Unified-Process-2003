<p>Test designs are created using information from a variety of artifacts, including 
  design artifacts such as use case realizations, design models, or classifier 
  interfaces. Tests are executed after components are created. It's typical to 
  create the test designs just before the tests are to be executed&#151;well after 
  the software design artifacts are created. Figure 1, following, shows an example. 
  Here, test design begins sometime toward the end of implementation. It draws 
  on the results of component design. The arrow from Implementation to Test Execution 
  indicates that the tests can't be executed until the implementation is complete.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstfrsdsg-img1.gif" width="614" height="159"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig1: Traditionally, Test Design is performed later in the life-cycle</p>

<p>However, it doesn't have to be this way. Although test execution has to wait 
  until the component has been implemented, test design can be done earlier. It 
  could be done just after the design artifact is completed. It could even be 
  done in parallel with component design, as shown here:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstfrsdsg-img2.gif" width="610" height="158"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig2: Test-first Design brings test design chronologically 
  in-line with software design</p>

<p>Moving the test effort &quot;upstream&quot; in this way is commonly called 
  &quot;test-first design&quot;. What are its advantages?</p>
<ol>
  <li>No matter how carefully you design software, you'll make mistakes. You might 
    be missing a relevant fact. Or you might have particular habits of thought 
    that make it hard for you to see certain alternatives. Or you might just be 
    tired and overlook something. Having other people review your design artifacts 
    helps. They might have the facts you miss, or they might see what you overlooked. 
    It's best if these people have a different perspective than you do; by looking 
    at the design differently, they'll see things you missed. <br>
    <br>
    Experience has shown that the testing perspective is an effective one. It's 
    relentlessly concrete. During software design, it's easy to think of a particular 
    field as &quot;displaying the title of the current customer&quot; and move 
    on without really thinking about it. During test design, you must decide <i>specifically</i> 
    what that field will show when a customer who retired from the Navy and then 
    obtained a law degree insists on referring to himself as &quot;Lieutenant 
    Morton H. Throckbottle (Ret.), Esq.&quot; Is his title &quot;Lieutenant&quot; 
    or &quot;Esquire&quot;?<br>
    <br>
    If test design is deferred until just before test execution, as in Figure 
    1, you'll probably waste money. A mistake in your software design will remain 
    uncaught until test design, when some tester says, &quot;You know, I knew 
    this guy from the Navy...&quot;, creates the &quot;Morton&quot; test, and 
    discovers the problem. Now a partially or fully complete implementation has 
    to be rewritten and a design artifact has to be updated. It would be cheaper 
    to catch the problem before implementation begins.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some mistakes might be caught before test design. Instead, they'll be caught 
    by the Implementer. That's still bad. Implementation must grind to a halt 
    while the focus switches from how to implement the design to what that design 
    should be. That's disruptive even when the Implementer and Designer roles 
    are filled by the same person; it's much more disruptive when they're different 
    people. Preventing this disruption is another way in which test-first design 
    helps improve efficiency.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Test designs help Implementers in another way&#151;by clarifying design. 
    If there's a question in the Implementer's mind about what the design meant, 
    the test design might serve as a specific example of the desired behavior. 
    That will lead to fewer bugs due to Implementer misunderstanding.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are fewer bugs even if the question <i>wasn't</i> in the Implementer's 
    mind&#151;but should have been. For example, there might have been an ambiguity 
    that the Designer unconsciously interpreted one way and the Implementer another. 
    If the Implementer is working from both the design and also from specific 
    instructions about what the component is supposed to do&#151;from test cases&#151;the 
    component is more likely to actually do what is required.</li>
</ol>


<h3><a name="Examples">Examples</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>Here are some examples to give you the flavor of test-first design.</p>

<p>Suppose you're creating a system to replace the old &quot;ask the secretary&quot; 
  method of assigning meeting rooms. One of the methods of the <font face="Courier New">MeetingDatabase</font> 
  class is called <font face="Courier New">getMeeting</font>, which has this signature:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Meeting getMeeting(Person, Time);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Given a person and a time, <font face="Courier New">getMeeting</font> returns 
  the meeting that person is scheduled to be in at that time. If the person isn't 
  scheduled for anything, it returns the special <font face="Courier New">Meeting</font> 
  object <font face="Courier New">unscheduled</font>. There are some straightforward test cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The person isn't in any meeting at the given time. Is the <font face="Courier New">unscheduled</font> 
    meeting returned? </li>
  <li>The person is in a meeting at that time. Does the method return the correct 
    meeting?</li>
</ul>

<p>These test cases are unexciting, but they need to be tried eventually. They 
  might as well be created now, by writing the actual test code that will someday 
  be run. Java code for the first test might look like this:</p>
<pre>
    // if not in a meeting at given time,
    // expect to be unscheduled.
    public void testWhenAvailable() {
        Person fred = new Person("fred");
        Time now = Time.now();
        MeetingDatabase db = new MeetingDatabase();

        expect(db.getMeeting(fred, now) == Meeting.unscheduled);
    }
</pre>

<p>But there are more interesting test ideas. For example, this method searches 
  for a match. Whenever a method searches, it's a good idea to ask what should 
  happen if the search finds more than one match. In this case, that means asking 
  &quot;Can a person be in two meetings at once?&quot; Seems impossible, but asking 
  the secretary about that case might reveal something surprising. It turns out 
  that some executives are quite often scheduled into two meetings at once. Their 
  role is to pop into a meeting, &quot;rally the troops&quot; for some short amount 
  of time, and then move on. A system that didn't accommodate that behavior would 
  go at least partially unused.</p>

<p>This is an example of test-first design done at the implementation level catching 
  an analysis problem. There are a few things to note about that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You would hope that good use-case specification and analysis would have 
    already discovered this requirement. In that case, the problem would have 
    been avoided &quot;upstream&quot; and <font face="Courier New">getMeeting</font> 
    would have been designed differently. (It couldn't return a meeting; it would 
    have to return a set of meetings.) But analysis always misses some problems, 
    and it's better for them to be discovered during implementation than after 
    deployment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In many cases, Designers and Implementers won't have the domain knowledge 
    to catch such problems&#151;they won't have the opportunity or time to quiz 
    the secretary. In that case, the person designing tests for <font face="Courier New">getMeeting</font> 
    would ask, &quot;is there a case in which two meetings should be returned?&quot;, 
    think for a while, and conclude that there wasn't. So test-first design doesn't 
    catch every problem, but the mere fact of asking the right kinds of questions 
    increases the chance a problem will be found.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some of the same testing techniques that apply during implementation also 
    apply to analysis. Test-first design can be done by analysts as well, but 
    that's not the topic of this page.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second of the three examples is a statechart model for a heating system. 
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstfrsdsg-img3.gif" width="567" height="253" alt="HVAC Statechart"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig3: HVAC Statechart</p>

<p>A set of tests would traverse all the arcs in the statechart. One test might 
  begin with an idle system, inject a Too Hot event, fail the system during the 
  Cooling/Running state, clear the failure, inject another Too Hot event, then run 
  the system back to the Idle state. Since that does not exercise all the arcs, 
  more tests are needed. These kinds of tests look for various kinds of implementation 
  problems. For example, by traversing every arc, they check whether the implementation 
  has left one out. By using sequences of events that have failure paths followed 
  by paths that should successfully complete, they check whether error-handling 
  code fails to clean up partial results that might affect later computation. 
  (For more about testing statecharts, see <a href="../../modguide/md_tstidssttact.htm">Guideline: 
  Test Ideas for Statechart and Activity Diagrams</a>.)</p>

<p>The final example uses part of a design model. There's an association between 
  a creditor and an invoice, where any given creditor can have more than one invoice 
  outstanding.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstfrsdsg-img4.gif" width="186" height="45"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig4: Association between Creditor and Invoice Classes</p>

<p>Tests based on this model would exercise the system when a creditor has no 
  invoices, one invoice, and a large number of invoices. A tester would also ask 
  whether there are situations in which an invoice might need to be associated 
  with more than one creditor, or where an invoice has no creditor. (Perhaps the 
  people who currently run the paper-based system the computer system is to replace 
  use creditor-less invoices as a way to keep track of pending work). If so, that 
  would be another problem that should have been caught in Analysis.</p>


<h3><a name="WhoDoesTest-FirstDesign">Who does test-first design?</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>Test-first design can be done by either the author of the design or by someone 
  else. It's common for the author to do it. The advantage is that it reduces 
  communication overhead. The artifact Designer and Test Designer don't have to 
  explain things to each other. Further, a separate Test Designer would have to 
  spend time learning the design well, whereas the original Designer already knows 
  it. Finally, many of these questions&#151;like &quot;what happens if the compressor 
  fails in state X?&quot;&#151;are natural questions to ask during both software 
  artifact design and test design, so you might as well have the same person ask 
  them exactly once and write the answers down in the form of tests.</p>

<p>There are disadvantages, though. The first is that the artifact Designer is, 
  to some extent, blind to his or her own mistakes. The test design process will 
  reveal some of that blindness, but probably not as much as a different person 
  would find. How much of a problem this is seems to vary widely from person to 
  person and is often related to the amount of experience the Designer has.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of having the same person do both software design and 
  test design is that there's no parallelism. Whereas allocating the roles to 
  separate people will take more total effort, it will probably result in less 
  elapsed calendar time. If people are itching to move out of design and into 
  implementation, taking time for test design can be frustrating. More importantly, 
  there's a tendency to skimp on the work in order to move on. </p>


<h3><a name="CanAllTestDesignBeDoneAtComponentDesignTime">Can all test design be done at component design time?</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>No. The reason is that not all decisions are made at design time. Decisions 
  made during implementation won't be well-tested by tests created from the design. 
  The classic example of this is a routine to sort arrays. There are many different 
  sorting algorithms with different tradeoffs. Quicksort is usually faster than 
  an insertion sort on large arrays, but often slower on small arrays. So a sorting 
  algorithm might be implemented to use Quicksort for arrays with more than 15 
  elements, but insertion sort otherwise. That division of labor might be invisible 
  from design artifacts. You <i>could</i> represent it in a design artifact, 
  but the Designer might have decided that the benefit of making such explicit 
  decisions wasn't worthwhile. Since the size of the array plays no role in the 
  design, the test design might inadvertently use only small arrays, meaning that 
  none of the Quicksort code would be tested at all.</p>

<p>As another example, consider this fraction of a sequence diagram. It shows 
  a <font face="Courier New">SecurityManager</font> calling the <font face="Courier New">log()</font> 
  method of <font face="Courier New">StableStore</font>. In this case, though, 
  the <font face="Courier New">log()</font> returns a failure, which causes <font face="Courier New">SecurityManager</font> 
  to call <font face="Courier New">Connection.close()</font>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstfrsdsg-img5.gif" width="303" height="161"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig5: SecurityManager sequence diagram instance</p>

<p>This is a good reminder to the Implementer. Whenever <font face="Courier New">log()</font> 
  fails, the connection must be closed. The question for testing to answer is 
  whether the Implementer really did it&#151;and did it correctly&#151;in <i>all</i> 
  cases or just in <i>some</i>. To answer the question, the Test Designer must 
  find all the calls to <font face="Courier New">StableStore.log()</font> and 
  make sure each of those call points is given a failure to handle. </p>

<p>It might seem odd to run such a test, given that you've just looked at all 
  the code that calls <font face="Courier New">StableStore.log()</font>. Can't 
  you just check to see if it handles failure correctly?</p>

<p>Perhaps inspection might be enough. But error-handling code is notoriously 
  error-prone because it often implicitly depends on assumptions that the existence 
  of the error has violated. The classic example of this is code that handles 
  allocation failures. Here's an example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
while (true) { // top level event loop
    try {
        XEvent xe = getEvent();
        ...                      // main body of program
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
        emergencyRestart();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This code attempts to recover from out of memory errors by cleaning up (thus 
  making memory available) and then continuing to process events. Let's suppose 
  that's an acceptable design. <font face="Courier New">emergencyRestart</font> 
  takes great care not to allocate memory. The problem is that <font face="Courier New">emergencyRestart</font> 
  calls some utility routine, which calls some other utility routine, which calls 
  some other utility routine&#151;which allocates a new object. Except that there's 
  no memory, so the whole program fails. These kinds of problems are hard to find 
  through inspection.</p>

<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>

<p>Up to this point, we've implicitly assumed that you'd do as much test design 
  as possible as early as possible. That is, you'd derive all the tests you could 
  from the design artifact, later adding only tests based on implementation internals. 
  That may not be appropriate in the Elaboration phase, because such complete 
  testing may not be aligned with an iteration's objectives.</p>

<p>Suppose an architectural prototype is being built to demonstrate product feasibility 
  to investors. It might be based on a few key use-case instances. Code should 
  be tested to see that it supports them. But is there any harm if further tests 
  are created? For example, it might be obvious that the prototype ignores important 
  error cases. Why not document the need for that error handling by writing test 
  cases that will exercise it?</p>

<p>But what if the prototype does its job and reveals that the architectural approach 
  won't work? Then the architecture will be thrown away - along with all those 
  tests for error-handling. In that case, the effort of designing the tests will 
  have yielded no value. It would have been better to have waited, and only designed 
  those tests needed to check whether this proof-of-concept prototype really proves 
  the concept.</p>

<p>This may seem a minor point, but there are strong psychological effects in 
  play. The Elaboration phase is about addressing major risks. The whole project 
  team should be focused on those risks. Having people concentrating on minor 
  issues drains focus and energy from the team.</p>

<p>So where might test-first design be used successfully in the Elaboration phase? 
  It can play an important role in adequately exploring architectural risks. Considering 
  how, precisely, the team will know if a risk has been realized or avoided will 
  add clarity to the design process and may well result in a better architecture 
  being built the first time.</p>

<p>During the Construction phase, design artifacts are put into their final form. 
  All the required use case realizations are implemented, as are 
  the interfaces for all classes. Because the phase objective is completeness, 
  complete test-first design is appropriate. Later events should invalidate few, 
  if any, tests.</p>

<p>The Inception and Transition phases typically have less focus on design activities 
  for which testing is appropriate. When it is, test-first design is applicable. 
  For example, it could be used with candidate proof of concept work in Inception. 
  As with Construction and Elaboration phase testing, it should be aligned with 
  iteration objectives.</p>
