<p>Much of programming involves taking things you've used over and over before, 
  and then using them yet again in a different context. Those things are typically 
  of certain classes&#151;data structures (such as linked lists, hash tables, 
  or relational databases) or <a href="../../glossary.htm#operation" target="_blank"><i>operations</i></a> 
  (such as searching, sorting, creating temporary files, or popping up a browser 
  window). For example, two customer relational databases will have many clichéd 
  characteristics.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about these clichés is that they have clichéd <a href="../../glossary.htm#fault" target="_blank"><i>faults</i></a>. 
  People do not invent imaginative new ways to insert something incorrectly into 
  a doubly-linked list. They tend to make the same mistakes that they and others 
  have made before. A programmer who pops up a browser window might make one of 
  these clichéd mistakes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creates a new window when one that's already open should be reused</li>
  <li>fails to make an obscured or minimized browser window visible</li>
  <li>uses Internet Explorer when the user has chosen a different default browser</li>
  <li>fails to check whether JavaScript is enabled</li>
</ul>

<p>Since faults are clichéd, so are the <a href="../../glossary.htm#test_idea" target="_blank"><i>test 
  ideas</i></a> that can find them. Put these test ideas in your test-idea catalog 
  so you can reuse them.</p>

<h3><a name="HowCatalogsFindFaults">How a Test-Ideas Catalog Finds Faults</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>One of the virtues of a catalog is that a single test idea can be useful for 
  finding more than one underlying fault. Here's an example of one idea that finds 
  two faults.</p>

<p>The first fault was in a C compiler. This compiler took command-line options 
  like &quot;-table&quot; or &quot;-trace&quot; or &quot;-nolink&quot;. The options 
  could be abbreviated to their smallest unique form. For example, &quot;-ta&quot; 
  was as good as &quot;-table&quot;. However, &quot;-t&quot; was not allowed, 
  because it was ambiguous: it could mean either &quot;-table&quot; or &quot;-trace&quot;.</p>

<p>Internally, the command-line options were stored in a table like this:</p>
<div align="left">
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="25%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">-table</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">-trace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">-nolink</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br></div>

<p>When an option was encountered on the command line, it was looked up in the 
  table. It matched if it was the prefix of any table entry; that is, &quot;-t&quot; 
  matched &quot;-table&quot;. After one match was found, the rest of the table 
  was searched for another match. Another match would be an error, because it 
  would indicate ambiguity.</p>

<p>The code that did the searching looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
for (first=0; first &lt size; first++) {
    if (matches(entry[first], thing_sought)) {
        /* at least one match */
        for(dup=first+1; dup &lt size; dup++)
            /* search for another */
            if (matches(entry[dup], thing_sought))
                /* extra match */
                break;  /* error out */
        return first;
    }
}
return -1;	/* Not found or ambiguity */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see the problem? It's fairly subtle.</p>

<p>The problem is the break statement. It's intended to break out of the outermost 
  enclosing loop when a duplicate match is found, but it really breaks out of 
  the inner one. That has the same effect as not finding a second match: the index 
  of the first match is returned.</p>

<p>Notice that this fault can only be found if the option being sought for matches 
  twice in the table, as &quot;-t&quot; would.</p>

<p>Now let's look at a second, completely different fault.</p>

<p>The code takes a string. It is supposed to replace the last '=' in the string 
  with a '+'. If there is no '=', nothing is done. The code uses the standard 
  C library routine <font face="Courier New">strchr</font> to find the location 
  of '='. Here's the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
ptr = strchr(string, &#145;=&#146;);	/* Find last = */
if (ptr != NULL_CHAR)
    *ptr = &#145;+&#146;;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem here is also somewhat subtle.</p>

<p>The function <font face="Courier New">strchr</font> returns the <i>first</i> 
  match in the string, not the last. The correct function is <font face="Courier New">str<b><u>r</u></b>chr</font>. 
  The problem was most likely a typographical error. (Actually, the deep underlying 
  problem is that it's definitely unwise to put two functions that differ only 
  by a typo into a standard library.)</p>

<p>This fault can only be found when there are two or more equal signs in the 
  input. That is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;a=b&quot; would return the correct result, &quot;a+b&quot;.</li>
  <li>&quot;noequals&quot; would return the correct result, &quot;noequals&quot;.</li>
  <li>&quot;a=b=c&quot; would incorrectly return &quot;a+b=c&quot;, not the correct 
    &quot;a=b+c&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>What's interesting and useful here is that we have two faults with completely 
  different root causes (typographical error, misunderstanding of a C construct) 
  and different manifestations in the code (wrong function called, misuse of break 
  statement) that can be found by the <i>same</i> test idea (search for something 
  that occurs twice). </p>


<h3><a name="GoodCatalogs">A Good Test-Ideas Catalog</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>What makes a good catalog?</p>
<ul>
  <li>It contains a small set of test ideas that can find a much larger set of 
    underlying faults. </li>
  <li>It's easy to read quickly (skim). You should be able to skip test ideas 
    that are not relevant to your situation.</li>
  <li>It contains only test ideas that you will use. For example, someone who 
    doesn't ever deal with Web browsers shouldn't have to keep skipping over test 
    ideas for programs that use Web browsers. Someone working on game software 
    will want a shorter catalog than someone working on safety-critical software. 
    The game person can afford to concentrate only on the test ideas with the 
    highest chance of finding faults.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these rules, it seems best to have more than one catalog. Some data and 
  operations are common to all programming, so their test ideas can be put into 
  a catalog that all programmers can use. Others are specific to a particular 
  domain, so test ideas for them can be put into a catalog of domain-specific 
  test ideas.</p>

<p>A <a href="../../../examples/extrnlcntrbtns/test/tstids_short-catalog.pdf" target="_blank">sample 
  catalog</a>, used in the following example, is a good one from which to begin. 
  <a href="../../../examples/extrnlcntrbtns/test/tstatmtch.htm">Test Ideas for 
  Mixtures of ANDs and ORs</a> provides another example.</p>


<h3><a name="UsingACatalogExample">An Example of Using a Test-Ideas Catalog</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Here's how you might use the <a href="../../../examples/extrnlcntrbtns/test/tstids_short-catalog.pdf" target="_blank">sample 
  catalog</a>. Suppose you're implementing this method:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void applyToCommonFiles(Directory d1,
                        Directory d2,
                        Operation op);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> takes two directories as 
  arguments. When a file in the first directory has the same name as a file in 
  the second, <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> performs some 
  operation on that pair of files. It descends subdirectories.</p>

<p>The method for using the catalog is to scan through it looking for major headings 
  that match your situation. Consider the test ideas under each heading to see 
  if they are relevant, and then write those that are relevant into a <a href="co_tstidslst.htm">Test-Ideas 
  List</a>. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This step-by-step description might make using the catalog seem 
  laborious. It takes longer to read about creating the checklist than it does 
  to actually create one.</p>
<p>So, in the case of <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font>, you 
  might apply the catalog in the manner described throughout the rest of this 
  section.</p>

<p>The first entry is for <b>Any Object</b>. Could any of the arguments be null 
  pointers? This is a matter of the contract between <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> 
  and its callers. The contract could be that the callers will not pass in a null 
  pointer. If they do, you can't rely on th expected behavior: <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> 
  could perform any action. In such a case, no test is appropriate, since nothing 
  <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> does can be wrong. If, however, 
  <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> is required to check for 
  null pointers, the test idea would be useful. Let's assume the latter, which 
  gives us this starting Test-Ideas List:</p>
<ul>
  <li>d1 is null (error case)</li>
  <li>d2 is null (error case)</li>
  <li>op is null (error case)</li>
</ul>

<p>The next catalog entry is <b>Strings</b>. The names of the files are strings, 
  and they're compared to see if they match. The idea of testing with the empty 
  string (&quot;&quot;) doesn't seem useful. Presumably some standard string comparison 
  routines will be used, and they will handle empty strings correctly.</p>

<p>But wait... If there are strings being compared, what about case? Suppose <font face="Courier New">d1</font> 
  contains a file named &quot;File&quot; and <font face="Courier New">d2</font> 
  contains a file named &quot;file&quot;. Should those files match? On UNIX, clearly 
  not. On Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174;, they almost certainly should. That's 
  another test idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Files match in the two directories, but the case of the names is different.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that this test idea didn't come directly from the catalog. However, 
  the catalog drew our attention to a particular aspect of the program (file names 
  as strings), and our creativity gave us an additional idea. It's important not 
  to use the catalog too narrowly&#151;use it as a brainstorming technique, a way 
  of inspiring new ideas.</p>

<p>The next entry is <b>Collections</b>. A directory is a collection of files. 
  Many programs that handle collections fail on the empty collection. A few that 
  handle the empty collection, or collections with many elements, fail on collections 
  with exactly one element. So these ideas are useful:</p>
<ul>
    <li>d1 is empty</li>
    <li>d2 is empty</li>
    <li>d1 has exactly one file</li>
    <li>d2 has exactly one file</li>
</ul>

<p>The next idea is to use a collection of the maximum possible size. This is 
  useful because programs like <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> 
  are often tested with trivial little directories. Then some user comes along 
  and applies them to two huge directory trees with thousands of files in them, 
  only to discover that the program is grotesquely memory inefficient and can't 
  handle that realistic case. </p>

<p>Now, testing the absolute maximum size for a directory is not important; it 
  only needs to be as large as a user might try. However, at the very least, there 
  should be <i>some</i> test with more than three files in a directory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>d1 contains very many files</li>
  <li>d2 contains very many files</li>
</ul>

<p>The final test idea (duplicate elements) doesn't apply to directories of files. 
  That is, if you have a directory with two files that have the same name, you 
  have a problem independent of <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font>&#151your 
  file system is corrupt.</p>

<p>The next catalog entry is <b>Searching</b>. Those ideas can be translated into 
  <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> terms like this:</p>

<ul>
    
  <li>d1 and d2 have no files in common (all the names are different)</li>
    
  <li>d1 and d2 have exactly one file in common (it's alphabetically the last 
    element in the directory)</li>
    
  <li>d1 and d2 have more than one file in common</li>
</ul>

<p>The final test idea checks whether <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> 
  terminates too soon. Does it return as soon as it finds the first match? The 
  parenthetical remark in the test idea before that assumes that the program will 
  fetch the list of files in a directory using some library routine that returns 
  them, sorted alphabetically. If not, it might be better to find out what the 
  last one really is (the most recently created?) and make that be the match. 
  Before you devote a lot of time to finding out how files are ordered, though, 
  ask yourself how likely it is that putting the matching element last will make 
  finding defects easier. Putting an element last in a collection is more useful 
  if the code explicitly steps through the collection using an index. If it's 
  using an iterator, it's extremely unlikely that the order matters.</p>

<p>Let's look at one more entry in the sample catalog. The <b>Linked structures</b> 
  entry reminds us that we're comparing directory <i>trees</i>, not just flat 
  collections of files. It would be sad if <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> 
  worked only in the top-level directories, but not in the lower-level ones. Deciding 
  how to test whether <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> works 
  in lower-level directories forces us to confront the incompleteness of its description. 
</p>

<p>First, when does <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> descend 
  into subdirectories? If the directory structure looks like this</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstidsctl-img1.gif" width="334" height="162"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Figure 1: A directory structure</p>

<p>does <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> descend into <font face="Courier New">Cdir</font>? 
  That doesn't seem to make sense. There can be no match with anything in the 
  other directory tree. In fact, it seems as if files in subdirectories can only 
  match if the subdirectory names match. That is, suppose we have this directory 
  structure:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstidsctl-img2.gif" width="334" height="165"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Figure 2: A second directory structure</p>

<p>The files named &quot;File&quot; don't match because they're in different subdirectories 
  The subdirectories should be descended only if they have the same name in both 
  <font face="Courier New">d1</font> and <font face="Courier New">d2</font>. That 
  leads to these test ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>some subdirectory in d1 is not found in d2 (no descent)</li>
  <li>some subdirectory in d2 is not found in d1 (no descent)</li>
  <li>some subdirectory appears in both d1 and d2 (descend)</li>
</ul>

<p>But that raises other questions. Should the operation (<font face="Courier New">op</font>) 
  be applied to matching subdirectories or just to matching files? If it's applied 
  to the subdirectories, should it be applied before the descent or afterward? 
  That makes a difference if, for example, the operation deletes the matching 
  file or directory. For that matter, <i>should</i> the operation be allowed to 
  modify the directory structure? And more specifically: what's the correct behavior 
  of <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> if it does? (This is the 
  same issue that comes up with iterators.)</p>

<p>These sorts of questions typically arise when you carefully read a method's 
  description of creating test ideas. But let's leave them aside for now. Whatever 
  the answers are, there will have to be test ideas for them&#151;test ideas that 
  check whether the code correctly implements the answers.</p>

<p>Let's return to the catalog. We still haven't considered all of its test ideas. 
  The first one&#151;empty (nothing in structure)&#151;asks for an empty directory. 
  We've already got that from the <b>Collections</b> entry. We've also got the 
  <b>minimal non-empty</b> structure, which is a directory with a single element. 
  This sort of redundancy is not uncommon, but it's easy to ignore.</p>

<p>What about <b>a circular structure</b>? Directory structures can't be circular&#151;a 
  directory can't be within one of its descendants or within itself... or can 
  it? What about shortcuts (on Windows) or symbolic links (on UNIX)? If there's 
  a shortcut in <font face="Courier New">d1</font>'s directory tree that points 
  back to <font face="Courier New">d1</font>, should <font face="Courier New"> 
  applyToCommonFiles</font> keep descending forever? The answer could lead to 
  one or more new test ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>d1 is circular because of shortcuts or symbolic links</li>
  <li>d2 is circular because of shortcuts or symbolic links</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the correct behavior, there may be more test ideas than that.</p>

<p>Finally, what about <b>depth greater than one</b>? Earlier test ideas will 
  ensure that we test descending into one level of subdirectory, but we should 
  check that <font face="Courier New">applyToCommonFiles</font> keeps descending:</p>
<ul>
  <li>descends through several levels (&gt;1) of d1's subdirectories</li>
  <li>descends through several levels (&gt;1) of d2's subdirectories</li>
</ul>

  Catalog</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>As mentioned previously, the generic catalog won't contain all of the test 
  ideas you need. But <a href="../../glossary.htm#domain" target="_blank"><i>domain</i></a>-specific 
  catalogs haven't been published outside of the companies that created them. 
  If you want them, you'll need to build them. Here's some advice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not fill a catalog with your speculations about what ideas would be good 
    for finding faults. Remember that each test idea you put in the catalog costs 
    time and money: 
    <ul>
      <li>your time to maintain the catalog</li>
      <li>other programmers' time to think about the test idea</li>
      <li>possibly other programmers' time to implement a test</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Add only ideas that have a demonstrated track record. You should be able to 
    point to at least one actual fault that the test idea would have caught. Ideally, 
    the fault should be one that was missed by other testing; that is, one that 
    was reported from the field. One good way to build catalogs is to browse through 
    your company's bug database and ask questions about how each fault could have 
    been detected earlier.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>It's unlikely to work if creating and maintaining a Test-Ideas Catalog is 
    something you do in your spare time. You'll need time specifically allocated 
    to this task, just like for any other important one. We recommend you create 
    and maintain your Test-Ideas Catalog during <a href="wfs_imptstast.htm">Workflow 
    Detail: Improve Test Assets</a>.</li>
