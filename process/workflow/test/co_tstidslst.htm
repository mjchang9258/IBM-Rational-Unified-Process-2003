<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Information used in designing tests is gathered from many places: design models, 
  classifier interfaces, statecharts, and code itself. At some point, this source 
  document information must be transformed into executable tests:</p>

<ul>
    
  <li>specific inputs given to the software under test</li>
    
  <li>in a particular hardware and software configuration</li>
    
  <li>initialized to a known state</li>
    
  <li>with specific results expected</li>
</ul>

<p>It's possible to go directly from source document information to executable 
  tests, but it's often useful to add an intermediate step. In this step, <a href="../../glossary.htm#test_idea" target="_blank"><i>test 
  ideas</i></a> are written into a <i>Test-Ideas List</i>, which is used to create 
  executable tests.</p>


<h3><a name="TestIdeas">What are Test Ideas?</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>A test idea (sometimes referred to as a <a href="../../glossary.htm#test_requirement" target="_blank"><i>test 
  requirement</i></a>) is a brief statement about a test that could be performed. 
  As a simple example, let's consider a function that calculates a square root 
  and come up with some test ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give a number that's barely less than zero as input</li>
  <li>give zero as the input</li>
  <li>test a number that's a perfect square, like 4 or 16 (is the result exactly 
    2 or 4?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these ideas could readily be converted into an executable test with 
  exact descriptions of inputs and expected results.</p>

<p>There are two advantages to this less-specific intermediate form:</p>
<ul>
  <li>test ideas are more reviewable and understandable than complete tests&#151;it's 
    easier to understand the reasoning behind them</li>
  <li>test ideas support more powerful tests, as described later under the heading 
    <a href="#TestDesignUsingTheList">Test Design Using the List</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The square root examples all describe inputs, but test ideas can describe any 
  of the elements of an executable test. For example, &quot;print to a LaserJet 
  IIIp&quot; describes an aspect of the <a href="../../glossary.htm#test_environment" target="_blank"><i>test 
  environment</i></a> to be used for a test, as does &quot;test with database 
  full&quot;, however, these latter test ideas are very incomplete in themselves: 
  Print <b>what</b> to the printer? Do <b>what</b> with that full database? They 
  do, however, ensure that important ideas aren't forgotten; ideas that will be 
  described in more detail later in test design.</p>

<p>Test ideas are often based on <a href="../../glossary.htm#fault_model" target="_blank"><i>fault 
  models</i></a>; notions of which faults are plausible in software and how those 
  faults can best be uncovered. For example, consider boundaries. It's safe to 
  assume the square root function can be implemented something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
double sqrt(double x) {
    if (x &lt; 0) 
      // signal error
    ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also plausible that the <font face="Courier New">&lt;</font> will be incorrectly 
  typed as <font face="Courier New">&lt;=</font>. People often make that kind 
  of mistake, so it's worth checking. The fault cannot be detected with <font face="Courier New">X</font> 
  having the value <font face="Courier New">2</font>, because both the incorrect 
  expression (<font face="Courier New">x&lt;=0</font>) and the correct expression 
  (<font face="Courier New">x&lt;0</font>) will take the same branch of the <font face="Courier New">if</font> 
  statement. Similarly, giving <font face="Courier New">X</font> the value -<font face="Courier New">5</font> 
  cannot find the fault. The only way to find it is to give <font face="Courier New">X</font> 
  the value <font face="Courier New">0</font>, which justifies the second test 
  idea.</p>

<p>In this case, the fault model is explicit. In other cases, it's implicit. For 
  example, whenever a program manipulates a linked structure, it's good to test 
  it against a circular one. It's possible that many faults could lead to a mishandled 
  circular structure. For the purposes of testing, they needn't be enumerated&#151;it 
  suffices to know that some fault is likely enough that the test is worth running.</p>

<p>The following links provide information about getting test ideas from different 
  kinds of fault models. The first two are explicit fault models; the last uses 
  implicit ones.</p> 

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../modguide/md_tstidsblnbnd.htm">Guidelines: Test Ideas for 
    Booleans and Boundaries </a></li>
  <li><a href="../../modguide/md_tstidsmthcls.htm">Guidelines: Test Ideas for 
    Method Calls </a></li>
  <li><a href="co_tstidsctlg.htm">Concepts: Test-Ideas Catalog </a></li>
</ul>

<p>These fault models can be applied to many different artifacts. For example, 
  the first one describes what to do with Boolean expressions. Such expressions 
  can be found in code, in guard conditions, in statecharts and sequence diagrams, 
  and in natural-language descriptions of method behaviors (such as you might 
  find in a published API).</p> 

<p>Occasionally it's also helpful to have guidelines for specific artifacts. See 
  <a href="../../modguide/md_tstidssttact.htm">Guidelines: Test Ideas for Statechart 
  and Flow Diagrams</a>.</p>
<p>A particular Test-Ideas List might contain test ideas from many fault models, 
  and those fault models could be derived from more than one artifact.</p>


<h3><a name="TestDesignUsingTheList">Test Design Using the List</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>

<p>Let's suppose you're designing tests for a method that searches for a string 
  in a sequential collection. It can either obey case or ignore case in its search, 
  and it returns the index of the first match found or -1 if no match is found.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
int Collection.find(String string,
                    Boolean ignoreCase);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some test ideas for this method:</p>
<ol>
    <li>match found in the first position</li>
    <li>match found in the last position</li>
    <li>no match found</li>
    
  <li>two or more matches found in the collection</li>
  <li>case is ignored; match found, but it wouldn't match if case was obeyed</li>
  <li>case is obeyed; an exact match is found</li>
    <li>case is obeyed; a string that would have matched if case
        were ignored is skipped</li>
</ol>

<p>It would be simple to implement these seven tests, one for each test idea. 
  However, different test ideas can be combined into a single test. For example, 
  the following test <i>satisfies</i> test ideas 2, 6, and 7:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Setup: collection initialized to [&quot;dawn&quot;, &quot;Dawn&quot;]<br>
    Invocation: collection.find(&quot;Dawn&quot;, false)<br>
    Expected result: return value is 1 (it would be 0 if &quot;dawn&quot;
    were not skipped)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making test ideas nonspecific makes them easier to combine.</p>

<p>It's possible to satisfy all of the test ideas in three tests. Why would three 
  tests that satisfy seven test ideas be better than seven separate tests?</p>
<ul>
  <li>When you're creating a large number of simple tests, it's common to create 
    test N+1 by copying test N and tweaking it just enough to satisfy the new 
    test idea. The result, especially in more complex software, is that test N+1 
    probably exercises the program in almost the same way as test N. It takes 
    almost exactly the same path through the code.<br>
    <br>
    A smaller number of tests, each satisfying several test ideas, doesn't allow 
    a &quot;copy and tweak&quot; approach. Each test will be somewhat different 
    from the last, exercising the code in different ways and taking different 
    paths.<br>
    <br>
    Why would that be better? If the Test-Ideas List were complete, with a test 
    idea for every fault in the program, it wouldn't matter how you wrote the 
    tests. But the list is always missing some test ideas that could find bugs. 
    By having each test do very different things from the last one&#151;by adding 
    seemingly unneeded variety&#151;you increase the chance that one of the tests 
    will stumble over a bug by sheer dumb luck. In effect, smaller, more complex 
    tests increase the chance the test will satisfy a test idea that you didn't 
    know you needed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Sometimes when you're creating more complex tests, new test ideas come to 
    mind. That happens less often with simple tests, because so much of what you're 
    doing is exactly like the last test, which dulls your mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are reasons for not creating complex tests.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If each test satisfies a single test idea and the test for idea 2 fails, 
    you immediately know the most likely cause: the program doesn't handle a match 
    in the last position. If a test satisfies ideas 2, 6, and 7, then isolating 
    the failure is harder.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Complex tests are more difficult to understand and maintain. The intent 
    of the test is less obvious.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Complex tests are more difficult to create. Constructing a test that satisfies 
    five test ideas often takes more time than constructing five tests that each 
    satisfy one. Moreover, it's easier to make mistakes&#151;to think you're satisfying 
    all five when you're only satisfying four.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, you must find a reasonable balance between complexity and simplicity. 
  For example, the first tests you subject the software to (typically the <a href="../../glossary.htm#smoke_test" target="_blank"><i>smoke 
  tests</i></a>) should be simple, easy to understand and maintain, and intended 
  to catch the most obvious problems. Later tests should be more complex, but 
  not so complex they are not maintainable.</p>

<p>After you've finished a set of tests, it's good to check them against the characteristic 
  test design mistakes discussed in <a href="co_dvltst.htm#TestDesignMistakes">Concepts: 
  Developer Testing</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="UsingTestIdeasBeforeTest">Using Test Ideas Before Testing</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>A Test-Ideas List is useful for reviews and inspections of design artifacts. 
  For example, consider this part of a <a href="../../glossary.htm#design_model" target="_blank"><i>design 
  model</i></a> showing the association between Department and Employee classes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tstidslst-img1.gif" width="223"
height="45"></p>

<p class="picturetext">Figure 1: Association between Department and Employee Classes</p>

<p>The rules for creating test ideas from such a model would ask you to consider 
  the case where a department has many employees. By walking through a design 
  and asking &quot;what if, at this point, the department has many employees?&quot;, 
  you might discover design or analysis errors. For example, you might realize 
  that only one employee at a time can be transferred between departments. That 
  might be a problem if the corporation is prone to sweeping reorganizations where 
  many employees need to be transferred.</p>

<p>Such faults, cases where a possibility was overlooked, are called <i>faults 
  of omission</i>. Just like the faults themselves, you have probably omitted 
  tests that detect these faults from your testing effort. For example, see <a href="../../referenc.htm#GLA81">[GLA81]</a>, 
  <a href="../../referenc.htm#OST84">[OST84]</a>, <a href="../../referenc.htm#BAS87">[BAS87]</a>, 
  <a href="../../referenc.htm#MAR00">[MAR00]</a>, and other studies that show 
  how often faults of omission escape into deployment.</p> 

<p>The role of testing in design activities is discussed further in <a href="co_tstfrsdsg.htm">Concepts: 
  Test-first Design</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="TestIdeasTraceability">Test Ideas and Traceability</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>


<p><a href="../../glossary.htm#traceability" target="_blank"><i>Traceability</i></a> 
  is a matter of tradeoffs. Is its value worth the cost of maintaining it? This 
  question needs to be considered during <a href="../../activity/ac_tst_dfnasstrcnds.htm">Activity: 
  Define Assessment and Traceability Needs</a>.</p>

<p>When traceability is worthwhile, it's conventional to trace tests back to the 
  artifacts that inspired them. For example, you might have traceability between 
  an API and its tests. If the API changes, you know which tests to change. If 
  the code (that implements the API) changes, you know which tests to run. If 
  a test puzzles you, you can find the API it's intended to test.</p>

<p>The Test-Ideas List adds another level of traceability. You can trace from 
  a test to the test ideas it satisfies, and then from the test ideas to the original 
  artifact. </p>
