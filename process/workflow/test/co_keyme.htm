<p>The key measures of a test include coverage and quality.</p>
<p>Test coverage is the measurement of testing completeness, and it's based on 
  the coverage of testing expressed by the coverage of test requirements and test 
  cases or by the coverage of executed code.</p>
<p>Quality is a measure of the reliability, stability, and performance of the 
  target-of-test (system or application-under-test). Quality is based on evaluating 
  test results and analyzing change requests (defects) identified during testing.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_measures__types_of_test_coverage"></a><b><a name="Coverage">Coverage Measures</a>
</b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Coverage metrics provide answers to the question: &quot;How complete is the 
  testing?&quot; The most commonly-used measures of coverage are based on the 
  coverage of software requirements and source code. Basically, test coverage 
  is any measure of completeness with respect to either a requirement (requirement-based), 
  or the code's design and implementation criteria (code-based), such as verifying 
  use cases (requirement-based) or executing all lines of code (code-based).</p>
<p>Any systematic testing activity is based on at least one test coverage
strategy. The coverage strategy guides the design of test cases by stating the
general purpose of the testing. The statement of coverage strategy can be as
simple as verifying all performance.</p>
<p>A requirements-based coverage strategy might be sufficient for yielding a quantifiable 
  measure of testing completeness if the requirements are completely cataloged. 
  For example, if all performance test requirements have been identified, then 
  the test results can be referenced to get measures; for example, 75% of the 
  performance test requirements have been verified.</p>
<p>If code-based coverage is applied, test strategies are formulated in terms of
how much of the source code has been executed by tests. This type of test
coverage strategy is very important for safety-critical systems.</p>
<p>Both measures can be derived manually (using the equations given in the next 
  two headings) or may be calculated using test automation tools.</p>
<h4><a name="Requirements-based test coverage">Requirements-based Test Coverage</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Requirements-based test coverage, measured several times during the test lifecycle, 
  identifies the test coverage at a milestone in the testing lifecycle, such as 
  the planned, implemented, executed, and successful test coverage. 
<ul>
  <li>Test coverage is calculated using the following equation:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  
    <p class="example">Test Coverage = T<sup><sup>(p,i,x,s)</sup></sup> / RfT<br>
    <br>
    where:<br>
    T is the number of Tests (planned, implemented, executed, or successful), 
    expressed as test procedures or test cases.</p>
    <p class="example">RfT is the total number of Requirements for Test.</p>
  
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>In the Plan Test activity, the test coverage is calculated to determine 
    the planned test coverage in the following manner:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
 
    <p class="example">Test Coverage (planned) = T<sup><sup>p</sup></sup> / RfT<br>
    <br>
    where:<br>
    T<sup><sup>p</sup></sup> is the number of planned Tests, expressed as test 
    procedures or test cases.</p>
    <p class="example">RfT is the total number of Requirements for Test.</p>
  
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>In the Implement Test activity, as test procedures are being implemented 
    (as test scripts) test coverage is calculated using the following equation:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  
    <p class="example">Test Coverage (implemented) = T<sup><sup>i</sup></sup> /
    RfT<br>
    <br>
    where:<br>
    T<sup><sup>i</sup></sup> is the number of Tests implemented, expressed by 
    the number of test procedures or test cases for which there are corresponding 
    test scripts.</p>
    <p class="example">RfT is the total number of Requirements for Test.</p>
 
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>In the Execute Test activity, there are two test coverage measures used&#151;one 
    identifies the test coverage achieved by executing the tests and the second 
    identifies the successful test coverage (those tests that executed without 
    failures, such as defects or unexpected results). 
    <p>These coverage measures are calculated using the following equations:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="example">Test Coverage (executed) = T<sup><sup>x</sup></sup> /
      RfT</p>
	  </blockquote>
      <blockquote><p class="example">where:<br>
      T<sup><sup>x</sup></sup> is the number of Tests executed, expressed as
      test procedures or test cases.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <blockquote>
      <p class="example">RfT is the total number of Requirements for Test.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
</ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="example">Successful Test Coverage (executed) = T<sup><sup>s</sup></sup>
    / RfT</p>
 
  <blockquote>
    <p class="example">where:<br>
      T<sup><sup>s</sup></sup> is the number of Tests executed, expressed as test 
      procedures or test cases that completed successfully, without defects.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="example">RfT is the total number of Requirements for Test.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</ul>
<p>Turning the above ratios into percentages allows for the following statement of
requirements-based test coverage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>x% of test cases (T<sup><sup>(p,i,x,s)</sup></sup> in the above equations)
  have been covered with a success rate of y%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meaningful statement of test coverage can be matched against a defined 
  success criteria. If the criteria have not been met, then the statement provides 
  a basis for predicting how much testing effort remains.</p>
<h4><a name="Code-based test coverage">Code-based Test Coverage</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Code-based test coverage measures how much code has been executed during the 
  test, compared to how much code is left to execute. Code coverage can be based 
  on control flows (statement, branch, or paths) or data flows. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In control-flow coverage, the aim is to test lines of code, branch conditions, 
    paths through the code, or other elements of the software's flow of control. 
  </li>
  <li>In data-flow coverage, the aim is to test that data states remain valid 
    through the operation of the software; for example, that a data element is 
    defined before it's used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code-based test coverage is calculated by the following equation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">Test Coverage = I<sup><sup>e</sup></sup> / TIic</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">where:<br>
  I<sup><sup>e</sup></sup> is the number of items executed, expressed as code
  statements, code branches, code paths, data state decision points, or data
  element names.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p class="example">TIic is the total number of items in the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning this ratio into a percentage allows the following statement of
code-based test coverage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>x% of test cases (I in the above equation) have been covered with a success
  rate of y%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This meaningful statement of test coverage can be matched against a defined 
  success criteria. If the criteria have not been met, then the statement provides 
  a basis for predicting how much testing effort remains.</p>


<h3><a name="XE_measures__for_perceived_quality"></a><b><a name="Quality">Measuring 
  Perceived Quality</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Although evaluating test coverage provides a measure of the extent of completeness 
  of the testing effort, evaluating defects discovered during testing provides 
  the best indication of the software quality as it has been experienced. This 
  perception of quality can be used to reason about the general quality of the 
  software system as a whole. Perceived Software Quality is a measure of how well 
  the software meets the requirements levied on it, therefore, in this context, 
  defects are considered as a type of change request in which the target-of-test 
  failed to meet the software requirements.</p>
<p>Defect evaluation could be based on methods that range from simple defect counts 
  to rigorous statistical modeling.</p>
<p>Rigorous evaluation uses assumptions about the arrival or discovery rates of 
  defects during the testing process. A common model assumes that the rate follows 
  a Poisson distribution. The actual data about defect rates are then fit to the 
  model. The resulting evaluation estimates the current software reliability and 
  predicts how the reliability will grow if testing and defect removal continue. 
  This evaluation is described as software-reliability growth modeling and it's 
  an area of active study. Due to the lack of tool support for this type of evaluation, 
  you want to carefully balance the cost of using this approach with the benefits 
  gained.</p>
<p><b>Defects analysis</b> involves analyzing the distribution of defects 
  over the values of one or more of the attributes associated with a defect. 
  Defect analysis provides an indication of the reliability of the software.</p>
<p>In defect analysis, four main defect attributes are commonly analyzed:
<ul>
  <li><b>Status</b> &#151 the current state of the defect (open, being fixed, closed, and so forth).</li>
  <li><b>Priority</b> &#151 the relative importance of this defect being addressed and
    resolved.</li>
  <li><b>Severity</b> &#151 the relative impact of this defect to the end-user, 
    an organization, third parties, and so on.</li>
  <li><b>Source</b> &#151 where and what is the originating fault that results in this
    defect or what component will be fixed to eliminate this defect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Defect counts can be reported as a function of time, creating a Defect Trend 
  diagram or report. They can also be reported in a Defect Density Report as a 
  function of one or more defect attributes, like severity or status. These types 
  of analysis provide a perspective on the trends or on the distribution of defects 
  that reveal the software's reliability.<br>
  <br>
  For example, it's expected that defect discovery rates will eventually diminish 
  as the testing and fixing progresses. A defect or poor quality threshold can 
  be established at which point the software quality will be unacceptable. Defect 
  counts can also be reported based on the origin in the Implementation model, 
  allowing for detection of &quot;weak modules&quot;, &quot;hot spots&quot;, and 
  parts of the software that keep being fixed again and again, which indicates 
  more fundamental design flaws.</p>
<p>Only confirmed defects are included in an analysis of this kind. Not all reported 
  defects denote an actual flaw; some might be enhancement requests outside of 
  the project's scope, or may describe a defect that's already been reported. 
  However, it's valuable to look at and analyze why many defects, which are either 
  duplicates or not confirmed defects, are being reported.</p>


<h4><a name="Defect Reports">Defect Reports</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The Rational Unified Process recommends defect evaluation based on multiple 
  reporting categories, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Defect Distribution (Density) Reports allow defect counts to be shown as 
    a function of one or two defect attributes.</li>
  <li>Defect Age Reports are a special type of defect distribution report. Defect 
    age reports show how long a defect has been in a particular state, such as 
    Open. In any age category, defects can also be sorted by another attribute, 
    such as Owner.</li>
  <li>Defect Trend Reports show defect counts, by status (new, open, or closed), 
    as a function of time. The trend reports can be cumulative or non-cumulative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these reports are valuable in assessing software quality. They are 
  most useful when analyzed in conjunction with Test results and progress reports 
  that show the results of the tests conducted over a number of iterations and 
  test cycles for the application-under-test. The usual test criteria include 
  a statement about the tolerable numbers of open defects in particular categories, 
  such as severity class, which is easily checked with an evaluation of defect 
  distribution. By sorting or grouping this distribution by test motivators, the 
  evaluation can be focused on important areas of concern.</p>

<p>Normally tool support is required to effectively produce reports of this kind.</p>
<h4><b><a name="Defect density reports:">Defect Density Reports</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<h5><b>Defect status versus priority</b></h5>
<p>Give each defect a priority. It's usually practical and sufficient to have 
  four levels of priority, such as: 
<ul>
  <li>Urgent priority (resolve immediately)</li>
  <li>High priority</li>
  <li>Normal priority</li>
  <li>Low priority</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: Criteria for a successful test could be expressed in terms of 
  how the distribution of defects over these priority levels should look. For 
  example, successful test criteria might be &quot;no Priority 1 defects and fewer 
  than five Priority 2 defects are open&quot;. A defect distribution diagram, 
  such as the following, should be generated.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas1.gif" width="378" height="233"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's clear that the criteria has not been met. This diagram needs to include 
  a filter to show only open defects, as required by the test criteria.</p>
<h5><b>Defect status versus severity</b></h5>
<p>Defect Severity Reports show how many defects there are for each severity class; 
  for example, fatal error, major function not performed, minor annoyance.</p>
<h5><b>Defect status versus location in the Implementation model</b></h5>
<p>Defect Source Reports show distribution of defects on elements in the Implementation 
  model.</p>
<h4><b><a name="Defect aging reports:">Defect Aging Reports</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Defect Age Analysis provides good feedback on the effectiveness of the testing 
  and the defect removal activities. For example, if the majority of older, unresolved 
  defects are in a pending-validation state, it probably means that not enough 
  resources are applied to the retesting effort.</p>
<h4><b><a name="Defect trend reports:">Defect Trend Reports</a> </b><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Defect Trend Reports identify defect rates and provide a particularly good 
  view of the state of the testing. Defect trends follow a fairly predictable 
  pattern in a testing cycle. Early in the cycle, the defect rates rise quickly, 
  then they reach a peak, and decrease at a slower rate over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas2.gif" width="373" height="230"></p>

<p>To find problems, the project schedule can be reviewed in light of this trend. 
  For example, if the defect rates are still rising in the third week of a four-week 
  test cycle, the project is clearly not on schedule.</p>
<p>This simple trend analysis assumes that defects are being fixed promptly and 
  that the fixes are being tested in subsequent builds, so that the rate of closing 
  defects should follow the same profile as the rate of finding defects. When 
  this does not happen, it indicates a problem with the defect-resolution process; 
  the defect fixing resources or the resources to retest and validate fixes could 
  be inadequate.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas3.gif" width="469" height="230"></p>

<p>The trend reflected in this report shows that new defects are discovered and 
  opened quickly at the beginning of the project, and that they decrease over 
  time. The trend for open defects is similar to that for new defects, but lags 
  slightly behind. The trend for closing defects increases over time as open defects 
  are fixed and verified. These trends depict a successful effort.</p>
<p>If your trends deviate dramatically from these, they may indicate a problem 
  and identify when additional resources need to be applied to specific areas 
  of development or testing.</p>
<p>When combined with the measures of test coverage, the defect analysis provides 
  a very good assessment on which to base the test completion criteria.</p>


<h3><a name="Performance">Performance Measures</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Several measures are used for assessing the performance behaviors of the target-of-test 
  and for focusing on capturing data related to behaviors such as response time, 
  timing profiles, execution flow, operational reliability, and limits. Primarily, 
  these measures are assessed in the Evaluate Test activity, however, there are 
  performance measures that are used during the Execute Test activity to evaluate 
  test progress and status.</p>
<p>The primary performance measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dynamic Monitoring</b> &#151; real-time capture and display of the status 
    and state of each test script being executed during the test execution.</li>
  <li><b>Response Time and Throughput Reports</b> &#151; measurement of the response 
    times and throughput of the target-of-test for specified actors and use cases.</li>
  <li><b>Percentile Reports</b> &#151; percentile measurement and calculation 
    of the data collected values.</li>
  <li><b>Comparison Reports</b> &#151; differences or trends between two (or more) 
    sets of data representing different test executions.</li>
  <li><b>Trace Reports</b> &#151; details of the messages and conversations between 
    the actor (test script) and the target-of-test.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Dynamic Monitoring">Dynamic Monitoring</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Dynamic monitoring provides real-time display and reporting during test execution, 
  typically in the form of a histogram or a graph. The report monitors or assesses 
  performance test execution by displaying the current state, status, and progress 
  of the test scripts.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas4.gif" alt="keymeas4.gif (4149 bytes)" width="501" height="333"></p>

<p>For example, in the preceding histogram, there are 80 test scripts executing 
  the same use case. In this graph, 14 test scripts are in the Idle state, 12 
  in the Query, 34 in SQL Execution, 4 in SQL Connect, and 16 in the Other state. 
  As the test progresses, you would expect to see the number of scripts in each 
  state change. The displayed output would be typical of a test execution that 
  is executing normally and is in the middle of its execution. However, if test 
  scripts remain in one state or do not show changes during test execution, this 
  could indicate a problem with the test execution, or the need to implement or 
  evaluate other performance measures.</p>


<h4><a name="Response time and throughput reports">Response Time and Throughput 
  Reports</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Response Time and Throughput Reports, as their name implies, measure and calculate 
  the performance behaviors related to time and throughput (number of transactions 
  processed). Typically, these reports are displayed as a graph with response 
  time (or number of transactions) on the &quot;y&quot; axis and events on the 
  &quot;x&quot; axis.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas5.gif" alt="keymeas5.gif (6939 bytes)" width="499" height="333"></p>

<p>It's often valuable to calculate and display statistical information, such 
  as the mean and standard deviation of the data values in addition to showing 
  the actual performance behaviors.</p>


<h4><a name="Percentile Reports">Percentile Reports</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Percentile Reports provide another statistical calculation of performance by 
  displaying population percentile values for data types collected.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/keymeas6.gif" alt="keymeas6.gif (5644 bytes)" width="499" height="333"></p>


<h4><a name="Comparison Reports">Comparison Reports</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>It's important to compare the results of one performance test execution with 
  that of another, so you can evaluate the impact of changes made between test 
  executions on the performance behaviors. Use Comparison Reports to display the 
  difference between two sets of data (each representing different test executions) 
  or trends between many executions of test.</p>


<h4><a name="Trace and Profile Reports">Trace and Profile Reports</a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>When performance behaviors are acceptable or when performance monitoring indicates 
  possible bottlenecks (such as when test scripts remain in a given state for 
  exceedingly long periods), trace reporting could be the most valuable report. 
  Trace and Profile Reports display lower-level information. This information 
  includes the messages between the actor and the target-of-test, execution flow, 
  data access, and the function and system calls.</p>
