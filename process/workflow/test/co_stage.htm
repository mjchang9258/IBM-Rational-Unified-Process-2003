<p> Testing is applied to different types of targets, in different stages or levels 
  of work effort. These levels are distinguished typically by those roles that 
  are best skilled to design and conduct the tests, and where techniques are most 
  appropriate for testing at each level. It's important to ensure a balance of 
  focus is retained across these different work efforts.</p>


<h3>Developer Testing<a name="XE_developer_testing__explanation_of"></a><a name="XE_unit_test__developer_testing"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Developer testing denotes the aspects of test design and implementation most 
  appropriate for the team of developers to undertake. This is in contrast to 
  Independent Testing. In most cases, test execution initially occurs with the 
  developer testing group who designed and implemented the test, but it is a good 
  practice for the developers to create their tests in such a way so as to make 
  them available to independent testing groups for execution.</p>
<p>Traditionally, developer testing has been considered mainly with respect to 
  unit testing. While some developers also perform varying levels integration 
  testing, this is largely dependent on culture and other context issues. We recommend 
  that developer testing should cover more than just testing independent units 
  in isolation.</p>
<h3>Independent Testing<a name="XE_independent_testing__explanation_of"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Independent testing denotes the test design and implementation most appropriately 
  performed by someone who is independent from the team of developers. You can 
  consider this distinction a superset, which includes Independent Verification 
  &amp; Validation. In most cases, test execution initially occurs with the independent 
  testing group that designed and implemented the test, but the independent testers 
  should create their tests to make them available to the developer testing groups 
  for execution. Boris Beizer gives the following explanation of the different 
  objective that independent testing has over developer testing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The purpose of independent testing is to provide a different perspective 
    and, therefore, different tests; furthermore to conduct those tests in a richer 
    [...] environment than is possible for the developer.&quot; [<a href="../../referenc.htm#BEI95">BEI95</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Independent Stakeholder Testing<a name="XE_stakeholder_testing__explanation_of"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An alternate view of independent testing is that it represents testing that 
  is based on the needs and concerns of various stakeholders. Therefore it's referred 
  to as Stakeholder Testing. This is an important distinction&#151;it helps to 
  include a broader set of stakeholder concerns than might traditionally be considered, 
  extending the somewhat generic &quot;customer&quot; with stakeholders such as 
  technical support staff, technical trainers, sales staff in additional to customers, 
  and end users.</p>
<p>As a final comment, <a href="../../glossary.htm#XP" target="_blank"><i>XP'</i></a>'s 
  notion of <i>customer tests</i> relates to this categorization of independent 
  testing in the RUP.</p>


<h3>Unit Testing<a name="XE_unit_test__explanation_of"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable elements of the software. 
  Typically unit testing is applied to components represented in the implementation 
  model to verify that control flows and data flows are covered, and that they 
  function as expected. The Implementer performs unit testing as the unit is developed. 
  The details of unit testing are described in the Implementation discipline.</p>
<!--
<p>These expectations are based on how the component participates in executing 
  a use case, which you find in sequence diagrams for that use case.</p>
-->

<h3>Integration Testing<a name="XE_integration_test__explanation_of"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Integration testing is performed to ensure that the components in the implementation 
  model operate properly when combined to execute a use case. The target-of-test 
  is a package or a set of packages in the implementation model. Often the packages 
  being combined come from different development organizations. Integration testing 
  exposes incompleteness or mistakes in the package's interface specifications.</p>
<p>In some cases, the assumption by developers is that other groups such as independent 
  testers will perform integration tests. This situation presents risks to the 
  software project and ultimately the software quality because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> integration areas are a common point of software failure.</li>
  <li>integration tests performed by independent testers typically use black-box 
    techniques and are typically dealing with larger software components.</li>
</ul>
<p>A better approach is to consider integration testing the repsonsibility of 
  both developer and independent testers, but make the strategy of each teams 
  testing effort does not overlap significantly. The exact nature of that overlap 
  is based on the needs of the individual project. We recommend you foster an 
  environment where developers and independent system testers share a single vision 
  of quality. See <a href="co_dvltst.htm">Concepts: Developer Testing</a> for 
  additional information.</p>


<h3>System Testing<a name="XE_system_test__explanation_of"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Traditionally system testing is done when the software is functioning as a 
  whole. An iterative lifecycle allows system testing to occur much earlier&#151;as 
  soon as well-formed subsets of the use-case behavior are implemented. Usually 
  the target is the system's end-to-end functioning elements.</p>


<h3>Acceptance Testing<a name="XE_acceptance_test__explanation_of"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p><i>User</i> acceptance testing is the final test action taken before deploying 
  the software. The goal of acceptance testing is to verify that the software 
  is ready, and that it can be used by end users to perform those functions and 
  tasks for which the software was built. See <a href="co_accte.htm">Concepts: 
  Acceptance Testing</a> for additional information.</p>
<p>There are other notions of acceptance testing, which are generally characterized 
  by a hand-off from one group or one team to another. For example, a <i>build 
  acceptance test</i> is the testing done to accept the hand-over of a new software 
  build from development into independent testing.</p>

<h3>A comment about sequence and timing of test levels<a name="XE_unit_test__explanation_of"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>
<p>Traditionally, unit testing is thought of as being implemented early in the 
  iteration as the first stage of testing: all units required to be passed before 
  subsequent stages are conducted. However, in an iterative development process, 
  this approach is as a general rule, inappropriate. A better approach is to identify 
  the unit, integration and system tests that offer most potential for finding 
  errors, then implement and execute them based on a combination of greatest risk 
  and supporting environement.</p>
