<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a>
</h3>
<p>The phrase &quot;Developer Testing&quot; is used to categorize the testing 
  activities most appropriately performed by software developers. It also includes 
  the artifacts created by those activities. Developer Testing encompasses the 
  work traditionally thought of under the following categories: Unit Testing, 
  much of Integration Testing, and some aspects of what is most often referred 
  to as System Testing. While Developer Testing is traditionally associated with 
  activities in the Implementation discipline, it also has a relationship to activities 
  in the Analysis and Design discipline.</p>
<p>By thinking of Developer Testing in this &quot;holistic&quot; way, you help 
  to mitigate some of the risk associated with the more &quot;atomistic&quot; 
  approach traditionally taken. In the traditional approach to Developer Testing, 
  the effort is initially focused on evaluating that all units are working independently. 
  Late in the development life-cycle, as the development work nears completion, 
  the integrated units are assembled into a working subsystem or system and tested 
  in this setting for the first time.</p>
<p>This approach has a number of failings. Firstly, because it encourages a staged 
  approach to the testing of the integrated units and later subsystems, any errors 
  identified during these tests are often found too late. This late discovery 
  typically results in the decision to take no corrective action, or it requires 
  major rework to correct. This rework is both expensive and detracts from making forward 
  progress in other areas. This increases the risk of the project being derailed 
  or abandoned.</p>
<p>Secondly, creating rigid boundaries between Unit, Integration and System Test 
  increases the probability that errors spanning the boundaries will be discovered 
  by no one. The risk is compounded when responsibility for these types of tests 
  is assigned to separate teams.</p>
<p>The style of developer testing recommended by RUP encourages the developer 
  to focus on the most valuable and appropriate tests to conduct at the given 
  point in time. Even within the scope of a single iteration, it is usually more 
  efficient for the developer to find and correct as many of the defects in her 
  own code as possible, without the additional overhead in hand-off to a separate 
  test group. The desired result is the early discovery of the most significant 
  software errors&#151;regardless of whether those errors are in the independent 
  unit, the integration of the units or the working of the integrated units within 
  a meaningful end-user scenario.</p>


<h3><a name="DeveloperTestingPitfalls"></a>Pitfalls Getting Started with Developer 
  Testing<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Many developers who begin trying to do a substantially more thorough job of 
  testing give up the effort shortly thereafter. They find that it does not seem 
  to be yielding value. Further, some developers who begin well with developer 
  testing find that they've created an unmaintainable test suite that is eventually 
  abandoned.</p>
<p>This page gives some guidelines for getting over the first hurdles and for 
  creating a test suite that avoids the maintainability trap. For more information, 
  see <a href="../../workguid/wg_mnttstste.htm">Guidelines: Maintaining Automated Test Suites</a>.</p>


<h4>Establish expectations<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Those who find developer testing rewarding do it. Those who view it as a chore 
  find ways to avoid it. This is simply in the nature of most developers in most 
  industries, and treating it as a shameful lack of discipline hasn't historically 
  been successful. Therefore, as a developer you should expect testing to be rewarding 
  and do what it takes to make it rewarding.</p>
<p>Ideal developer testing follows a very tight edit-test loop. You make a small 
  change to the product, such as adding a new method to a class, then you immediately 
  rerun your tests. If any test breaks, you know exactly what code is the cause. 
  This easy, steady pace of development is the greatest reward of developer testing. 
  A long debugging session should be exceptional.</p>
<p>Because it's not unusual for a change made in one class to break 
  something in another, you should expect to rerun not just the changed class's 
  tests, but many tests. Ideally, you rerun the complete test suite for your component 
  many times per hour. Every time you make a significant change, you
  rerun the suite, watch the results, and either proceed to the next
  change or fix the last change. Expect to spend some effort making
  that rapid feedback possible.</p>


<h4>Automate your tests<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Running tests often is not practical if tests are manual. For some components, 
  automated tests are easy. An example would be an in-memory database. It communicates 
  to its clients through an API and has no other interface to the outside world. 
  Tests for it would look something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
/* Check that elements can be added at most once. */

// Setup
Database db = new Database();
db.add("key1", "value1");

// Test
boolean result = db.add("key1", "another value");
expect(result == false);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The tests are different from ordinary client code in only one way: instead 
  of believing the results of API calls, they check. If the API makes client code 
  easy to write, it makes test code easy to write. If the test code is
  <i>not</i> easy to write, you've received an early warning that the
  API could be improved. Test-first design is thus consistent with the
  Rational Unified Process's focus on addressing important risks early.</p>
<p>The more tightly connected the component is to the outside world, however, 
  the harder it will be to test. There are two common cases: graphical user interfaces 
  and back-end components.</p>


<h5>Graphical user interfaces</h5>
<p>Suppose the database in the example above receives its data via a callback 
  from a user-interface object. The callback is invoked when the user fills in 
  some text fields and pushes a button. Testing this by manually filling in the 
  fields and pushing the button isn't something you want to do many times an hour. 
  You must arrange a way to deliver the input under programmatic control, typically 
  by &quot;pushing&quot; the button in code.</p>
<p>Pushing the button causes some code in the component to be executed. Most likely, 
  that code changes the state of some user-interface objects. So you must also 
  arrange a way to query those objects programmatically.</p>


<h5>Back-end components</h5>
<p>Suppose the component under test doesn't implement a database. Instead, it's 
  a wrapper around a real, on-disk database. Testing against that real database 
  might be difficult. It might be hard to install and configure. Licenses for 
  it might be expensive. The database might slow down the tests enough that you're 
  not inclined to run them often. In such cases, it's worthwhile to &quot;stub 
  out&quot; the database with a simpler component that does just enough to support 
  the tests.</p>
<p>Stubs are also useful when a component that your component talks to isn't ready 
  yet. You don't want your testing to wait on someone else's code.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../implemen/co_stubs.htm">Concepts: Stubs</a>.</p>


<h4>Don't write your own tools<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Developer testing seems pretty straightforward. You set up some objects, make 
  a call through an API, check the result, and announce a test failure if the 
  results aren't as expected. It's also convenient to have some way to group tests 
  so that they can be run individually or as complete suites. Tools that support 
  those requirements are called <i>test frameworks</i>.</p>

<p>Developer testing <b>is</b> straightforward, and the requirements for test 
  frameworks are not complicated. If, however, you yield to the temptation of 
  writing your own test framework, you'll spend much more time tinkering with 
  the framework than you probably expect. There are many test frameworks available, 
  both commercial and open source, and there's no reason not to use one of those.</p>


<h4>Do create support code<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Test code tends to be repetitive. It's common to see sequences of code like 
  this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// null name not allowed
retval = o.createName(""); 
expect(retval == null);

// leading spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName(" l"); 
expect(retval == null);

// trailing spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName("name "); 
expect(retval == null);

// first character may not be numeric
retval = o.createName("5allpha"); 
expect(retval == null);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This code is created by copying one check, pasting it, then editing it to make 
  another check.</p>
<p>The danger here is twofold. If the interface changes, much editing will have 
  to be done. (In more complicated cases, a simple global replacement won't suffice.) 
  Also, if the code is at all complicated, the intent of the test can be lost 
  amid all the text.</p>
<p>When you find yourself repeating yourself, seriously consider factoring out 
  the repetition into support code. Even though the code above is a simple example, 
  it's more readable and maintainable if written like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void expectNameRejected(MyClass o, String s) {
    Object retval = o.createName(s);
    expect(retval == null);
}
...

// null name not allowed
expectNameRejected(o, ""); 

// leading spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, " l"); 

// trailing spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, "name "); 

// first character may not be numeric.
expectNameRejected(o, "5alpha"); 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers writing tests often err on the side of too much copying-and-pasting. 
  If you suspect yourself of that tendency, it's useful to consciously err in 
  the other direction. Resolve that you will strip your code of all duplicate 
  text. </p>


<h4>Write the tests first<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Writing the tests after the code is a chore. The urge is to rush through it, 
  to finish up and move on. Writing tests before the code makes testing part of 
  a positive feedback loop. As you implement more code, you see more tests passing 
  until finally all the tests pass and you're done. People who write tests first 
  seem to be more successful, and it takes no more time. For more on putting tests 
  first, see <a href="co_tstfrsdsg.htm">Concepts: Test-first Design</a></p>


<h4>Keep the tests understandable<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>You should expect that you, or someone else, will have to modify the tests 
  later. A typical situation is that a later iteration calls for a change to the 
  component's behavior. As a simple example, suppose the component once declared 
  a square root method like this:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Courier New">double sqrt(double x);</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that version, a negative argument caused <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font> 
  to return NaN (&quot;not a number&quot; from the IEEE 754-1985 <i>Standard for 
  Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>). In the new iteration, the square root 
  method will accept negative numbers and return a complex result:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Courier New">Complex sqrt(double x);</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Old tests for <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font> will have to change. That 
  means understanding what they do, and updating them so that they work with the 
  new <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font>. When updating tests, you must take 
  care not to destroy their bug-finding power. One way that sometimes happens 
  is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
void testSQRT () {
	//  Update these tests for Complex 
	// when I have time -- bem
	/*
		double result = sqrt(0.0);
		...
	*/
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Other ways are more subtle: the tests are changed so that they actually run, 
  but they no longer test what they were originally intended to test. The end 
  result, over many iterations, can be a test suite that is too weak to catch 
  many bugs. This is sometimes called &quot;test suite decay&quot;. A decayed 
  suite will be abandoned, because it's not worth the upkeep.</p>
<p>You can't maintain a test's bug-finding power unless it's clear what <a href="co_tstidslst.htm#TestIdeas">Test 
  Ideas</a> a test implements. Test code tends to be under-commented, even though 
  it's often harder to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind it than product code.</p>
<p>Test suite decay is less likely in the direct tests for <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font> 
  than in indirect tests. There will be code that calls <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font>. 
  That code will have tests. When <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font> changes, 
  some of those tests will fail. The person who changes <font face="Courier New">sqrt</font> 
  will probably have to change those tests. Because he's less familiar with them, 
  and because their relationship to the change is less clear, he's more likely 
  to weaken them in the process of making them pass.</p>
<p>When you're creating support code for tests (as urged above), be careful: the 
  support code should clarify, not obscure, the purpose of the tests that use 
  it. A common complaint about object-oriented programs is that there's no one 
  place where anything's done. If you look at any one method, all you discover 
  is that it forwards its work somewhere else. Such a structure has advantages, 
  but it makes it harder for new people to understand the code. Unless they make 
  an effort, their changes are likely to be incorrect or to make the code even 
  more complicated and fragile. The same is true of test code, except that later 
  maintainers are even less likely to take due care. You must head off the problem 
  by writing understandable tests.</p>


<h4>Match the test structure to the product structure<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Suppose someone has inherited your component. They need to change a part of 
  it. They may want to examine the old tests to help them in their new design. 
  They want to update the old tests before writing the code (test-first design).</p>
<p>All those good intentions will go by the wayside if they can't find the appropriate 
  tests. What they'll do is make the change, see what tests fail, then fix those. 
  That will contribute to test suite decay.</p>
<p>For that reason, it's important that the test suite be well structured, and 
  that the location of tests be predictable from the structure of the product. 
  Most usually, developers arrange tests in a parallel hierarchy, with one test 
  class per product class. So if someone is changing a class named <font face="Courier New">Log</font>, 
  they know the test class is <font face="Courier New">TestLog</font>, and they 
  know where the source file can be found.</p>


<h4>Let tests violate encapsulation<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>You might limit your tests to interacting with your component exactly as client 
  code does, through the same interface that client code uses. However, this has 
  disadvantages. Suppose you're testing a simple class that maintains a doubly 
  linked list:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/dvltst-img1.gif" width="195" height="46"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig1: Double-linked list</p>

<p>In particular, you're testing the <font face="Courier New">DoublyLinkedList.insertBefore(Object 
  existing, Object newObject)</font> method. In one of your tests, you want to 
  insert an element in the middle of the list, then check if it's been inserted 
  successfully. The test uses the list above to create this updated list:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/dvltst-img2.gif" width="318" height="46"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig2: Double-linked list - item inserted</p>

<p>It checks the list correctness like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// the list is now one longer. 
expect(list.size()==3);

// the new element is in the correct position
expect(list.get(1)==m);

// check that other elements are still there.
expect(list.get(0)==a);
expect(list.get(2)==z);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems sufficient, but it's not. Suppose the list implementation is incorrect 
  and backward pointers are not set correctly. That is, suppose the updated list 
  actually looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/dvltst-img3.gif" width="318" height="73"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Fig3: Double-linked list - fault in implementation</p>

<p>If <font face="Courier New">DoublyLinkedList.get(int index)</font> traverses 
  the list from the beginning to the end (likely), the test would miss this failure. 
  If the class provides <font face="Courier New">elementBefore</font> and <font face="Courier New">elementAfter</font> 
  methods, checking for such failures is straightforward:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Check that links were all updated
expect(list.elementAfter(a)==m);
expect(list.elementAfter(m)==z);
expect(list.elementBefore(z)==m); //this will fail
expect(list.elementBefore(m)==a);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if it doesn't provide those methods? You could devise more elaborate 
  sequences of method calls that will fail if the suspected defect is present. 
  For example, this would work:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Check whether back-link from Z is correct.
list.insertBefore(z, x);
// If it was incorrectly not updated, X will have 
// been inserted just after A.
expect(list.get(1)==m); 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>But such a test is more work to create and is likely to be significantly harder 
  to maintain. (Unless you write good comments, it will not be at all clear why 
  the test is doing what it's doing.) There are two solutions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add the <font face="Courier New">elementBefore</font> and <font face="Courier New">elementAfter</font> 
    methods to the public interface. But that effectively exposes the implementation 
    to everyone and makes future change more difficult.</li>
  <li>Let the tests &quot;look under the hood&quot; and check pointers directly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter is usually the best solution, even for a simple class like <font face="Courier New">DoublyLinkedList</font> 
  and especially for the more complex classes that occur in your products.</p>
<p>Typically, tests are put in the same package as the class they test. They are 
  given protected or friend access.</p>


<h3><a name="TestDesignMistakes"></a>Characteristic Test Design Mistakes <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a> 
</h3>
<p>Each test exercises a component and checks for correct results. The design 
  of the test&#151;the inputs it uses and how it checks for correctness&#151;can 
  be good at revealing defects, or it can inadvertently hide them. Here are some 
  characteristic test design mistakes.</p>


<h4>Failure to specify expected results in advance<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Suppose you're testing a component that converts XML into HTML. A temptation 
  is to take some sample XML, run it through the conversion, then look at the 
  results in a browser. If the screen looks right, you "bless" the HTML by saving 
  it as the official expected results. Thereafter, a test compares the actual 
  output of the conversion to the expected results.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous practice. Even sophisticated computer users are used to 
  believing what the computer does. You are likely to overlook mistakes in the 
  screen appearance. (Not to mention that browsers are quite tolerant of misformatted 
  HTML.) By making that incorrect HTML the official expected results, you make 
  sure that the test can never find the problem.</p>
<p>It's less dangerous to doubly-check by looking directly at the HTML, but it's 
  still dangerous. Because the output is complicated, it will be easy to overlook 
  errors. You'll find more defects if you write the expected output by hand first.</p>


<h4>Failure to check the background<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Tests usually check that what should have been changed has been, but their 
  creators often forget to check that what should have been left alone has been 
  left alone. For example, suppose a program is supposed to change the first 100 
  records in a file. It's a good idea to check that the 101<sup>st</sup> hasn't 
  been changed.</p>
<p>In theory, you would check that nothing in the &quot;background&quot;&#151;the 
  entire file system, all of memory, everything reachable through the network&#151;has 
  been left alone. In practice, you have to choose carefully what you can afford 
  to check. But it's important to make that choice.</p>


<h4>Failure to check persistence<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Just because the component tells you a change has been made, that doesn't mean 
  it has actually been committed to the database. You need to check the database 
  via another route.</p>


<h4>Failure to add variety<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>A test might be designed to check the effect of three fields in a database 
  record, but many other fields need to be filled in to execute the test. Testers 
  will often use the same values over and over again for these &quot;irrelevant&quot; 
  fields. For example, they'll always use the name of their lover in a text field, 
  or 999 in a numeric field. </p>

<p>The problem is that sometimes what shouldn't matter actually does. Every so 
  often, there's a bug that depends on some obscure combination of unlikely inputs. 
  If you always use the same inputs, you stand no chance of finding such bugs. 
  If you persistently vary inputs, you might. Quite often, it costs almost nothing 
  to use a number different than 999 or to use someone else's name. When varying 
  the values used in tests costs almost nothing and it has some potential benefit, 
  then vary. (Note: It's unwise to use names of old lovers instead of your current 
  one if your current lover works with you.)</p>

<p>Here's another benefit. One plausible fault is for the program to use field 
  <i>X</i> when it should have used field <i>Y</i>. If both fields contain &quot;Dawn&quot;, 
  the fault can't be detected.</p>


<h4>Failure to use realistic data<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>It's common to use made-up data in tests. That data is often unrealistically 
  simple. For example, customer names might be "Mickey", "Snoopy", and "Donald". 
  Because that data is different from what real users enter - for example, it's 
  characteristically shorter - it can miss defects real customers will see. For 
  example, these one-word names wouldn't detect that the code doesn't handle names 
  with spaces. </p>
<p>It's prudent to make a slight extra effort to use realistic data.</p>


<h4>Failure to notice that the code does nothing at all<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Suppose you initialize a database record to zero, run a calculation that should 
  result in zero being stored in the record, then check that the record is zero. 
  What has your test demonstrated? The calculation might not have taken place 
  at all. Nothing might have been stored, and the test couldn't tell.</p>
<p>That example sounds unlikely. But this same mistake can crop up in subtler 
  ways. For example, you might write a test for a complicated installer program. 
  The test is intended to check that all temporary files are removed after a successful 
  installation. But, because of all the installer options, in that test, one particular 
  temporary file wasn't created. Sure enough, that's the one the program forgot 
  to remove.</p>


<h4>Failure to notice that the code does the wrong thing<a href="#Top"> <img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Sometimes a program does the right thing for the wrong reasons. As a trivial 
  example, consider this code:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
if (a < b && c) 
    return 2 * x;
else
    return x * x;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The logical expression is wrong, and you've written a test that causes it to 
  evaluate incorrectly and take the wrong branch. Unfortunately, purely by coincidence, 
  the variable X has the value 2 in that test. So the result of the wrong branch 
  is accidentally correct - the same as the result the right branch would have 
  given. </p>
<p>For each expected result, you should ask if there's a plausible way in which 
  that result could be gotten for the wrong reason. While it's often impossible 
  to know, sometimes it's not.</p>
