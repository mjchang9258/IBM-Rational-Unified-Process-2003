<h2 class="banner">Concepts:&nbsp;<rpw name="PresentationName">Test Strategy</rpw><a name="XE_test_strategy__introduction_to"></a></h2>
<p>A strategy for the testing portion of a project describes the general approach 
  and objectives of the test activities. It includes those stages of testing (unit, 
  integration, and system) to be addressed and the kinds of testing (function, 
  performance, load, stress) to be performed.</p>
<p>The strategy defines:
<ul>
  <li>Testing techniques and tools to be used.</li>
  <li>What test completion and success criteria will be used. For example, the 
    criteria might allow the software to progress to acceptance testing when 95% 
    of the test cases have been successfully executed. Another criterion is code 
    coverage. This criterion may, in a safety-critical system, be that 100% of 
    the code should be covered by tests.</li>
  <li>Special considerations affect resource requirements or have schedule implications 
    such as:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <ul>
      <li> testing all interfaces to external systems</li>
      <li>simulating physical damage or security threat</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<p>Some organizations have defined corporate test strategies, in which case you 
  work to apply those strategies to your specific project.</p>
<p>The most important dimensions around which you should plan your test activities 
  are: 
<ul>
  <li>What iteration you are you in and what are the goals of that iteration?</li>
  <li>What stage of test (unit test, integration test, system test) are you are 
    performing? You might work all stages of test in one iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now take a look at how the characteristics of your test activities can change 
  depending on where you are in the previously mentioned test dimensions. There 
  are many characteristics you could look at, such as resources needed and time 
  spent, but, at this point, focus on what is important to defining your test 
  strategy such as: 
<ul>
  <li>types of test (functional, stress, volume, performance, usability, distribution, 
    and so on)</li>
  <li>evaluation criteria used (code-based test coverage, requirements-based test 
    coverage, number of defects, mean-time-between-failure, and so on)</li>
  <li>testing techniques used (manual and automated)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no general pattern for how the types of tests are distributed over 
  the test cycles. You focus on different types of tests depending on the number 
  of iterations, the size of the iteration, and what kind of project this is that 
  you're testing.</p>
<p>You will find that the system test stage has a strong focus on making sure 
  you are covering all testable requirements expressed in terms of a set of test 
  cases. This means your completion criteria will focus on requirements-based 
  test coverage. In the integration and unit test stages, you will find code-based 
  test coverage is a more appropriate completion criterion. The next figure shows 
  how the use of these two types of test coverage measures can change as you develop 
  new iterations of your software. 
<ul>
  <li>The test plan should define sets of completion criteria for unit test, integration 
    test, and system test.</li>
  <li>You may have different sets of completion criteria defined for individual
    iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/testr001.gif" alt="testr001.gif (3438 bytes)" width="307" height="183"></p>
<p>On your project, consider automating your tests as much as possible, specifically 
  the kind of tests you repeat several times (regression tests). Keep in mind 
  that it costs time and resources to create and maintain automated tests. There 
  will always be some amount of manual testing on each project. The following 
  figure illustrates when and in what stages of testing you'll probably perform 
  manual tests.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/testr002.gif" width="307" height="183"></p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>The following tables show when the different types of tests are identified 
  and provide an example of the completion criteria to define. The first table 
  shows a &quot;typical&quot; MIS project.</p>
