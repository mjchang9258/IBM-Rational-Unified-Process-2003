<h3><a name="Nodes, Processors and Devices">Nodes, Processors and Devices</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Processors and Devices are common stereotypes of Node. The distinction between 
  the two may seem difficult to assess, as many devices now contain their own 
  CPUs. However, the distinction between processors and devices lies in the type 
  of software that executes on them. Processors execute programs/software that 
  were explicitly written for the system being developed. Processors are general-purpose 
  computing devices which have computing capacity, memory, and execution capability.</p>
<p>Devices execute software written that controls the functionality of the device 
  itself. Devices are typically attached to a processor that controls the device. 
  They typically execute embedded software and are incapable of running general-purpose 
  programs. Their functionality is typically controlled by device-driver software.</p>


<h3><a name="Distribution Patterns">Distribution Patterns</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There are a number of typical patterns of distribution in systems, depending 
  on the functionality of the system and the type of application. In many cases, 
  the distribution pattern is informally used to describe the 'architecture' of 
  the system, though the full architecture encompasses this but also many more 
  things. For example, many times a system will be described as having a 'client-server 
  architecture', although this is only the distribution aspect of the architecture. 
  This serves to highlight the importance of the distribution aspects of the system 
  and the extent to which they influence other architectural decisions.</p>
<p>The distribution patterns described below imply certain system characteristics, 
  performance characteristics, and process architectures. Each solves certain 
  problems but also poses unique challenges.</p>

 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In so-called &quot;client/server architectures&quot;, there are specialized 
  network processor nodes called <b>clients</b>, and nodes called <b>servers</b>. 
  Clients are consumers of services provided by a server. A client often services 
  a single user and often handles end-user presentation services (GUI's), while 
  the server usually provides services to several clients simultaneously; the 
  services provided are typically database, security or print services. The &quot;application 
  logic&quot;, or the business logic, in these systems is typically distributed 
  among both the client and the server. Distribution of the business logic is 
  called <b>application partitioning</b>.</p>
<p>In the following figure, Client A shows an example of a 2-tier architecture,
with most application logic located in the server. Client B shows a typical
3-tier architecture, with Business Services implemented in a Business Object
Server. Client C shows a typical web-based application.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dpatt01.gif" width="546" height="287"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Variations of Client-Server Architectures</p>
<p>In traditional client/server systems, most of the business logic is
implemented on clients; but some functionality is better suited to be located on
the server, for example functionality that often access data stored on the
server. By doing this, one can decrease the network traffic, which in most cases
is quite expensive (it is an order of magnitude or two slower than inter-process
communication).</p>
<p>Some characteristics:
<ul>
  <li>A system can consist of several different types of clients, examples of
    which include:
    <ul>
      <li>User workstations</li>
      <li>Network computers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clients and servers communicate by using various technologies, such as
    CORBA/IDL, or RPC (remote-procedure call) technologies.</li>
  <li>A system can consist of several different types of servers, examples of
    which include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Database servers</b>, handling database machines such as
        Sybase, Ingres, Oracle, Informix;</li>
      <li><b>Print servers</b>, handling the driver logic (queuing
        etc.) for a specific printer;</li>
      <li><b>Communication servers</b> (TCP/IP, ISDN, X.25),</li>
      <li><b>Window Manager servers</b> (X)</li>
      <li><b>File servers</b> (NFS under UNIX).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h4><a name="The 3-Tier Architecture">The '3-Tier Architecture'</a><a name="XE_architecture__3-tier"></a><a name="XE_distribution_patterns__3-tier_architecture"></a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The '3-tier Architecture' is a special case of the 'Client/Server Architecture' 
  in which functionality in the system is divided into 3 logical partitions: application 
  services, business services, and data services. The 'logical partitions' may 
  in fact map to 3 or more physical nodes.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/3-tier.gif" width="175" height="268"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Example of a 3-tier Architecture</p>

<p>The logical partitioning into these three 'tiers' reflects an observation about 
  how functionality in typical office applications tends to be implemented, and 
  how it changes. Application services, primarily dealing with GUI presentation 
  issues, tends to execute on a dedicated desktop workstation with a graphical, 
  windowing operating environment. Changes in functionality tends to be dictated 
  often by ease of use or aesthetic considerations, essentially <b>human factors</b> 
  issues.</p>
<p>Data services tend to be implemented using database server technology, which 
  tends to execute on one or more high-performance, high-bandwidth nodes that 
  serve hundreds or thousands of users, connected over a network. Data services 
  tend to change when the representation and relationships between stored information 
  changes.</p>
<p>Business services reflect encoded knowledge of business processes. They manipulate 
  and synthesize information obtained from the data services, and provide it to 
  the application services. Business services are typically used by many users 
  in common, so they tend to be located on specialized servers as well, though 
  the may reside on the same nodes as the data services.</p>
<p>Partitioning functionality along these lines provides a relatively reliable
pattern for scalability: by adding servers and re-balancing processing across
data and business servers, a greater degree of scalability is achieved.</p>

<h4><a name="The 'Fat Client Architecture'">The 'Fat Client Architecture'</a><a name="XE_architecture__fat-client"></a><a name="XE_distribution_patterns__fat-client_architecture"></a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The client is &quot;Fat&quot; since nearly everything runs on it (except in 
  a variation, called the '2-tier architecture', in which the data services are 
  located on a separate node). Application Services, Business Services and Data 
  Services all reside on client machine; the database server will be usually on 
  another machine.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/2-tier.gif" width="166" height="174"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Traditional 2-tier or &quot;Fat Client&quot; Architecture</p>

<p>'Fat Clients' are relatively simple to design and build, but more difficult 
  to distribute (they tend to be large and monolithic) and maintain. Because the 
  client machines tend to cache data locally for performance, local cache coherency 
  and consistency tend to be issues and areas warranting particular attention. 
  Changes to shared objects located in multiple local caches are difficult and 
  expensive to coordinate, involving as they do network broadcast of changes.</p>

<h4><a name="Web Application">The 'Fat Server Architecture'</a><a name="XE_architecture__fat-server"></a><a name="XE_distribution_patterns__fat-server_architecture"></a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum from the 'Fat Client' is the 'Fat Server' 
  or 'Anorexic Client'. A typical example is the web-browser application running 
  a set of HTML pages, there is very little application in the client at all. 
  Nearly all work takes place on one or more web servers and data servers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/dpatt04.gif" width="166" height="174"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Web Application</p>

<p>Web applications are easy to distribute, easy to change. They are relatively 
  inexpensive to develop and support (since much of the application infrastructure 
  is provided by the browser and the web server). They may however not provide 
  the desired degree of control over the application, and they tend to saturate 
  the network quickly if not well-designed (and sometimes despite being well-designed).</p>

<h4><a name="Distributed Client/Server">Distributed Client/Server Architecture</a><a name="XE_architecture__distributed_client/server"></a><a name="XE_distribution_patterns__distributed_client/server_architecture"></a>
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>In this architecture, the application, business and data services reside on 
  different nodes, potentially with specialization of servers in the business 
  services and data services tiers. A full realization of a 3-tier architecture.</p>


<h3><a name="The Peer-to-Peer Architecture">The Peer-to-Peer Architecture</a><a name="XE_architecture__peer-to-peer"></a><a name="XE_distribution_patterns__peer-to-peer_architecture"></a>
 <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In the peer-to-peer architecture, any process or node in the system may be 
  both client <b>and </b>server. Distribution of functionality is achieved 
  by grouping inter-related services together to minimize network traffic while 
  maximizing throughput and system utilization. Such systems tend to be complex, 
  and there is a greater need to be aware of issues such as dead-lock, starvation 
  between processes, and fault handling.</p>
