<p>A <a href="../../glossary.htm#design_mechanism"><b>design mechanism</b></a>
is a refinement of a corresponding <a href="../../glossary.htm#analysis_mechanism"><b>analysis
mechanism</b></a><i> </i>(see also <a href="co_amech.htm">Concepts: Analysis
Mechanisms</a>). A design mechanism adds concrete detail to the conceptual
analysis mechanism, but stops short of requiring particular technology - for
example, a particular vendor's implementation of, say, an object-oriented
database management system. As with analysis mechanisms, a design mechanism may
instantiate one or more patterns, in this case <a href="../../glossary.htm#architectural_pattern"><b>architectural</b><i>
</i></a>or<b> <a href="../../glossary.htm#design_pattern">design patterns</a></b><i>.</i></p>
<p>Similarly, an <a href="../../glossary.htm#implementation_mechanism"><b>implementation
mechanism</b></a> is a refinement of a corresponding design mechanism, using,
for example, a particular programming language and other implementation
technology (such as a particular vendor's middleware product). An implementation
mechanism may instantiate one or more<b> <a href="../../glossary.htm#idiom">idioms</a></b>
or implementation patterns.</p>

Characteristics of Design Mechanisms</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Consider the analysis mechanism for <b>Persistency</b>:
<ul>
  <li>There might be a need for many (2,000) small objects (200 bytes each) to
    be stored for a few seconds, with no need for survival.</li>
  <li>There might be a need for several very large objects to be stored
    permanently on disk for several months, never updated, but with
    sophisticated means of retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="inventory"></a>These objects will require different support for
persistency; the following characteristics of design mechanisms for persistency
support might be identified:
<ul>
  <li><b>In-memory storage</b>; characteristics: for up to 1 Mb total
    (size x volume); very fast access for read, write, update.</li>
  <li><b>Flash card</b>; characteristics: for up to 8 Mb; slow update
    and write access; moderate read access.</li>
  <li><b>Binary file</b>; characteristics: for 100 Kb to 200 Mb; slow
    update; slow read and write access.</li>
  <li><b>Database Management System (DBMS)</b>; characteristics: for
    100 Kb and upwards (with essentially no upper limit); even slower update,
    read and write access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these speeds are only rated 'slow' relative to in-memory
storage.&nbsp; Obviously, in some environments, the use of caching can improve
apparent access times.</p>

the Mapping between Design and Implementation Mechanisms</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Initially, the mapping between design mechanisms and implementation
mechanisms is likely to be less than optimal but it will get the project
running, identify yet-unseen risks, and trigger further investigations and
evaluations. As the project continues and gains more knowledge, the mapping
needs to be refined.</p>
<p>Proceed iteratively to refine the mapping between design and implementation
mechanisms, eliminating redundant paths, working both &quot;top-down&quot; and
&quot;bottom-up.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Working Top-Down. </b>When working &quot;top-down,&quot; new and
refined use-case realizations will put new requirements on the needed design
mechanisms via the analysis mechanisms needed. Such new requirements might
uncover additional characteristics of a design mechanism, forcing a split
between mechanisms. There is also a compromise between the system's complexity
and its performance:
<ul>
  <li>Too many different design mechanisms make the system too complex.</li>
  <li>Too few design mechanisms can create performance issues for some
    implementation mechanisms that stretch the limits of the reasonable ranges
    of their characteristics values.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Working Bottom-Up. </b>When working &quot;bottom-up,&quot;
investigating the available implementation mechanisms, you might find products
that satisfy several design mechanisms at once, but force some adaptation or
repartitioning of your design mechanisms. You want to minimize the number of
implementation mechanisms you use, but too few of them can also lead to
performance issues.</p>
<p>Once you decide to use a DBMS to store objects of class A, you might be
tempted to use it to store all objects in the system. This could prove very
inefficient, or very cumbersome. Not all objects which require persistency need
to be stored in the DBMS. Some objects may be persistent but may be frequently
accessed by the application, and only infrequently accessed by other
applications. A hybrid strategy in which the object is read from the DBMS into
memory and periodically synchronized may be the best approach.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="example">A flight can be stored in memory for fast access, and in a
DBMS for long term persistency; this however triggers a need for a mechanism to
synchronize both.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to have more than one design mechanisms associated with a
client class as a compromise between different characteristics.</p>
<p>Because implementation mechanisms often come in bundles in off-the-shelf
components (operating systems and middleware products) some optimization based
on cost, or impedance mismatch, or uniformity of style needs to occur. Also,
mechanisms often are inter-dependent, making clear separation of services into
design mechanisms difficult.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Examples</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p class="example">The notification mechanism can be based on the
      inter-process communication mechanism.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="example">The error reporting mechanism can be based on the
      persistency mechanism.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Refinement continues over the whole elaboration phase, and is always a
compromise between:
<ul>
  <li>An exact 'fit' with the requirements of the clients of the design
    mechanism, in terms of the expected characteristics.</li>
  <li>The cost and complexity of having too many different implementation
    mechanisms to acquire and integrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall goal is always to have a simple clean set of mechanisms that give
conceptual integrity, simplicity and elegance to a large system.</p>

<p>The <b>Persistence </b>design mechanisms can be mapped to
implementation mechanisms as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/co_dmec2.gif" width="325" height="216"></p>
<p>A possible mapping between analysis mechanisms and design mechanisms. Dotted
arrows mean &quot;is specialized by,&quot; implying that the characteristics of
the design mechanisms are inherited from the analysis mechanisms but that they
will be specialized and refined.</p>
<p>Once you have finished optimizing the mechanisms, the following mappings
exist:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/co_dmec3.gif" width="418" height="110"></p>
  <p class="picturetext">The design decisions for a client class in terms of
  mappings between mechanisms; the Flight class needs two forms of persistency:
  in-memory storage implemented by a ready-made library routine, and in a
  database implemented with an off-the-shelf ObjectStorage product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The map must be navigable in both directions, so that it is easy to determine
client classes when changing implementation mechanisms.

Design Mechanisms</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Design mechanisms, and details regarding their use, are documented in the <a href="../../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Artifact: 
  Project Specific Guidelines</a>. The relationship (or mapping) of analysis mechanisms 
  to design mechanisms to implementation mechanisms, and the associated rationale 
  for these choices, is documented in the <a href="../../artifact/ar_sadoc.htm">Artifact: 
  Software Architecture Document</a>.
<p></p>
<p>As with analysis mechanisms, design mechanisms can be modeled using a collaboration, 
  which may instantiate one or more <a href="../../glossary.htm#architectural_pattern"><b>architectural</b><i> 
  </i></a>or <b><a href="../../glossary.htm#design_pattern">design patterns</a>.</b> 
<h4>Example: A Persistency Mechanism</h4>
<p>This example uses an instance of a pattern for RDBMS-based persistency drawn
from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/index.html" target="_blank">JDBC&#153;
(Java Data Base Connectivity)</a>.&nbsp; Although we present the design here,
JDBC does supply actual code for some of the classes, so it is a short step from
what is presented here to an implementation mechanism.
<p>The figure Static View: JDBC shows the classes (strictly, the classifier
roles) in the collaboration.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc1.gif" width="571" height="382">
<p align="center"><b>Static View: JDBC</b>
<p align="left">The yellow-filled classes are the ones which were supplied, the
others (myDBClass etc.) were bound by the designer to create the mechanism.
<p align="left">In JDBC, a client will work with a <b>DBClass</b>
to read and write persistent data. The DBClass is responsible for accessing the
JDBC database using the <b>DriverManager</b> class. Once a database <b>Connection</b>
is opened, the DBClass can then create SQL statements that will be sent to the
underlying RDBMS and executed using the <b>Statement</b> class. The Statement
class is what &#147;talks&#148; to the database. The result of the SQL query is
returned in a <b>ResultSet</b> object.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
<p align="left">The <b>DBClass</b> class is responsible for
making another class instance persistent. It understands the OO-to-RDBMS mapping
and has the behavior to interface with the RDBMS. The DBClass flattens the
object, writes it to the RDBMS and reads the object data<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>from the RDBMS and builds the object. Every class that is persistent will
have a corresponding DBClass.&nbsp;
<p align="left">The <b>PersistentClassList</b> is used to return
a set of persistent objects as a result of a database query (e.g., DBClass.read()).
<p align="left">We now present a series of dynamic views, to show
how the mechanism actually works.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc2.gif" width="285" height="146">
<p align="center"><b>JDBC: Initialize</b>
<p>Initialization must occur before any persistent class can be
accessed.</p>
<p>To initialize the connection to the database, the DBClass must
load the appropriate driver by calling the DriverManager getConnection()
operation with a URL, user, and password.</p>
<p>The operation getConnection() attempts to establish a
connection to the given database URL. The DriverManager attempts to select an
appropriate driver from the set of registered JDBC drivers.</p>
<p><i>Parameters:</i></p>
<p><b>url</b>: A database url of the form jdbc:subprotocol:subname. This URL is 
  used to locate the actual database server and is not Web-related in this instance.</p>
<p><b>user</b>: The database user on whose behalf the Connection is being made</p>
<p><b>pass</b>: The user's password</p>
<p><i>Returns</i>:</p>
<p>a Connection to the URL.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc3.gif" width="478" height="253">
<p align="center"><b>JDBC: Create</b>
<p align="left">To create a new class, the persistency client asks the DBClass 
  to create the new class. The DBClass creates a new instance of PersistentClass 
  with default values. The DBClass then creates a new Statement using the Connection 
  class createStatement() operation. The Statement is executed and the data is 
  inserted into the database. 
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc4.gif" width="627" height="352">
<p align="center"><b>JDBC: Read</b>
<p>To read a persistent class, the persistency client asks the DBClass to read. 
  The DBClass creates a new Statement using the Connection class createStatement() 
  operation. The Statement is executed and the data is returned in a ResultSet 
  object. The DBClass then creates a new instance of the PersistentClass and populates 
  it with the retrieved data. The data is returned in a collection object, an 
  instance of the PersistentClassList class.</p>
<p>Note: The string passed to executeQuery() is not necessarily exactly the same 
  string as the one passed into the read(). The DBClass will build the SQL query 
  to retrieve the persistent data from the database, using the criteria passed 
  into the read(). This is because we do not want the client of the DBClass to 
  need the knowledge of the internals of the database to create a valid query. 
  This knowledge is encapsulated within DBClass.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc5.gif" width="473" height="255">
<p align="center"><b>JDBC: Update</b>
<p>To update a class, the persistency client asks the DBClass to update. The DBClass 
  retrieves the data from the given PersistentClass object, and creates a new 
  Statement using the Connection class createStatement() operation. Once the Statement 
  is built the update is executed and the database is updated with the new data 
  from the class.</p>
<p>Remember: It is the job of the DBClass to &quot;flatten&quot; the PersistentClass 
  and write it to the database. That is why is must be retrieved from the given 
  PersistentClass before creating the SQL Statement.</p>
<p>Note: In the above mechanism, the PersistentClass must provide access routines 
  for all persistent data so that DBClass can access them. This provides external 
  access to certain persistent attributes that would have otherwise have been 
  private. This is a price you have to pay to pull the persistence knowledge out 
  of the class that encapsulates the data.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jdbc6.gif" width="473" height="255">
<p align="center"><b>JDBC: Delete</b>
<p align="left">To delete a class, the persistency client asks the DBClass to 
  delete the PersistentClass. The DBClass creates a new Statement using the Connection 
  class createStatement() operation. The Statement is executed and the data is 
  removed from the database. 
<p align="left">In the implementation of this design, some decisions would be
made about the mapping of DBClass to the persistent classes, e.g. having one
DBClass per persistent class and allocating them to appropriate packages.&nbsp;
These packages will have a dependency on the supplied <i>java.sql</i> (see <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/index.html" target="_blank">JDBC<font size="-2"><sup>&#153;</sup></font>
API Documentation</a>) package which contains the supporting classes
DriverManager, Connection, Statement and ResultSet.</p>
