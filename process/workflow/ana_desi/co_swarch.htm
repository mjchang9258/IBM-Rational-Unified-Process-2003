<h2><a name="XE_architecture__introduction_to"></a><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Software architecture is a concept that is easy to understand, and that most
engineers intuitively feel, especially with a little experience, but it is hard
to define precisely. In particular, it is difficult to draw a sharp line between
design and architecture&#151architecture is one aspect of design that concentrates
on some specific features.</p>
<p>In <i>An Introduction to Software Architecture</i>, David Garlan and
Mary Shaw suggest that software architecture is a level of design concerned with
issues: &quot;Beyond the algorithms and data structures of the computation;
designing and specifying the overall system structure emerges as a new kind of
problem. Structural issues include gross organization and global control
structure; protocols for communication, synchronization, and data access;
assignment of functionality to design elements; physical distribution;
composition of design elements; scaling and performance; and selection among
design alternatives.&quot; [<a href="../../referenc.htm#GAR93">GAR93</a>]</p>
<p>But there is more to architecture than just structure; the IEEE Working Group
on Architecture defines it as &quot;the highest-level concept of a system <b>in
its environment</b>&quot; [<a href="../../referenc.htm#IEEE98">IEEE98</a>].
It also encompasses the &quot;fit&quot; with system integrity, with economical
constraints, with aesthetic concerns, and with style. It is not limited to an
inward focus, but takes into consideration the system as a whole in its user
environment and its development environment - an outward focus.</p>
<p>In the RUP, the architecture of a software system (at a
given point) is the organization or structure of the system's significant
components interacting through interfaces, with components composed of
successively smaller components and interfaces.</p>
<h2><a name="Architecture Description">Architecture Description</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>To speak and reason about software architecture, you must first define an
architectural representation, a way of describing important aspects of an
architecture. In the RUP, this description is captured in
the <a href="../../artifact/ar_sadoc.htm">Software Architecture Document</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Architectural Views">Architectural Views</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>We have chosen to represent software architecture in multiple <b>architectural
views</b>. Each architectural view addresses some specific set of concerns,
specific to stakeholders in the development process: end users, designers,
managers, system engineers, maintainers, and so on.</p>
<p>The views capture the major structural design decisions by showing how the
software architecture is decomposed into components,
and how components are connected by <b>connectors</b> to produce
useful <b>forms </b>[<a href="../../referenc.htm#PW92">PW92</a>].
These design choices must be tied to the <a href="../requirem/co_req.htm">requirements</a>,
functional, and supplementary, and other constraints. But these choices in turn
put further <b>constraints</b> on the requirements and on future
design decisions at a lower level.</p>
<h3><a name="A Typical Set of Architectural Views">A Typical Set of
Architectural Views</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Architecture is represented by a number of different architectural views,
which in their essence are extracts illustrating the &quot;architecturally
significant&quot; elements of the models. In the RUP, you
start from a typical set of views, called the &quot;4+1 view model&quot; [<a href="../../referenc.htm#KRU95">KRU95</a>].
It is composed of:
<ul>
  <li>The<b> </b><a href="../requirem/co_ucv.htm"><b>Use-Case View</b>,</a>
    which contains use cases and scenarios that encompasses architecturally
    significant behavior, classes, or technical risks. It is a subset of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_ucmod.htm">use-case
    model</a>.</li>
  <li>The<b> </b><a href="co_lview.htm"><b>Logical View</b></a>, which
    contains the most important <a href="../../artifact/ar_class.htm">design
    classes</a> and their organization into <a href="../../artifact/ar_despk.htm">packages</a>
    and <a href="../../artifact/ar_dsub.htm">subsystems</a>, and the
    organization of these packages and subsystems into <a href="co_layer.htm">layers</a>.
    It contains also some <a href="../../artifact/ar_ucrea.htm">use case
    realizations</a>. It is a subset of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_desmd.htm">design
    model</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="../implemen/co_impvw.htm"><b>Implementation View</b>,</a>
    which contains an overview of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_impmd.htm">implementation
    model</a> and its organization in terms of modules into packages and layers.
    The allocation of packages and classes (from the Logical View) to the
    packages and modules of the Implementation View is also described. It is a
    subset of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_impmd.htm">implementation model</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="co_pview.htm"><b>Process View</b></a>, which
    contains the description of the tasks (process and threads) involved, their
    interactions and configurations, and the allocation of design objects and
    classes to tasks. This view need only be used if the system has a
    significant degree of <a href="co_cncry.htm">concurrency</a>. In RUP, it is a subset of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_desmd.htm">design
    model</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="co_dview.htm"><b>Deployment View</b></a>, which
    contains the description of the various physical nodes for the most typical
    platform configurations, and the allocation of tasks (from the Process View)
    to the physical nodes. This view need only be used if the system is
    distributed. It is a subset of the <a href="../../artifact/ar_dplmdl.htm">deployment
    model</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The architectural views are documented in a <a href="../../artifact/ar_sadoc.htm">Software
Architecture Document</a>. You can envision additional views to express
different special concerns: user-interface view, security view, data view, and
so on. For simple systems, you may omit some of the views contained in the 4+1
view model.</p>
<h2><a name="Architectural Focus">Architectural Focus</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h2>
<p>Although the views above could represent the whole design of a system, the
architecture concerns itself only with some specific aspects:
<ul>
  <li>The <b>structure</b> of the model &#151 the organizational patterns,
    for example, <a href="co_layer.htm">layering</a>.</li>
  <li>The <b>essential elements </b>&#151<i> </i>critical <a href="../../artifact/ar_uc.htm">use
    cases</a>, main <a href="../../artifact/ar_class.htm">classes</a>, common
    mechanisms, and so on, as opposed to all the elements present in the model.</li>
  <li>A few <b>key scenarios</b> showing the main control flows
    throughout the system.</li>
  <li>The <b>services</b>, to capture modularity, optional features,
    product-line aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, architectural views are <b>abstractions</b><i>,</i> or
simplifications, of the entire design, in which important characteristics are
made more visible by leaving details aside. These characteristics are important
when reasoning about
<ul>
  <li>System evolution&#151going to the next development cycle.</li>
  <li>Reuse of the architecture, or parts of it, in the context of a product
    line.</li>
  <li>Assessment of supplementary qualities, such as performance, availability,
    portability, and safety.</li>
  <li>Assignment of development work to teams or subcontractors.</li>
  <li>Decisions about including off-the-shelf components.</li>
  <li>Insertion in a wider system.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Architectural Patterns">Architectural Patterns</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p><a href="../../glossary.htm#architectural_pattern"><b>Architectural
patterns</b></a> are ready-made forms that solve recurring architectural
problems. An <b>architectural framework</b> or an <b>architectural
infrastructure </b>(middleware) is a set of components on which you can
build a certain kind of architecture. Many of the major architectural
difficulties should be resolved in the framework or in the infrastructure,
usually targeted to a specific domain: command and control, MIS, control system,
and so on.</p>
<h4>Examples of Architectural Patterns</h4>
<p>[<a href="../../referenc.htm#BUS96">BUS96</a>] groups architectural patterns
according to the characteristics of the systems in which they are most
applicable, with one category dealing with more general structuring issues. The
table shows the categories presented in [<a href="../../referenc.htm#BUS96">BUS96</a>]
and the patterns they contain.</p>

<p>Two of these are presented in more detail here, to clarify these ideas; for a
complete treatment see [<a href="../../referenc.htm#BUS96">BUS96</a>]. Patterns
are presented in the following widely used form:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pattern name</li>
  <li>Context</li>
  <li>Problem
    <ul>
      <li>Forces describing different problem aspects that should be considered</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Pattern Name</h5>
<p><b><i>Layers</i></b></p>
<h5>Context</h5>
<p>A large system that requires decomposition.</p>
<h5>Problem</h5>
<p>A system which must handle issues at different levels of abstraction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>For example: hardware control issues, common services issues and domain-specific 
  issues. It would be extremely undesirable to write vertical components that 
  handle issues at all levels. The same issue would have to be handled (possibly 
  inconsistently) multiple times in different components.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Forces</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parts of the system should be replaceable</li>
    <li>Changes in components should not ripple</li>
    <li>Similar responsibilities should be grouped together</li>
    <li>Size of components&#151complex components may have to be decomposed<font size="3"></font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Structure the systems into groups of components that form layers on top of 
  each other. Make upper layers use services of the layers below only (never above). 
  Try not to use services other than those of the layer directly below (don’t 
  skip layers unless intermediate layers would only add pass-through components).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p>1. Generic Layers</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/layers.gif" width="508" height="313"></p>
  <p align="left">A strict layered architecture states that design elements (classes, 
    packages, subsystems) only use the services of the layer below them.&nbsp; 
    Services can include event-handling, error-handling, database access, and 
    so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It contains more palpable 
    mechanisms, as opposed to raw operating system level calls documented in the 
    bottom layer.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Business System Layers</p>
  <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/layers2.gif" width="615" height="398"></p>
  <p align="left">The above diagram shows another layering example, where there 
    are vertical application-specific layers, and horizontal, infrastructure layers. 
    Note that the goal is to have very short business &#147;stovepipes&#148; and to leverage 
    commonality across applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If 
    not, you may have multiple people solving the same problem, potentially differently.</p>
  <p align="left">See<a href="../../modguide/md_layer.htm"> Guidelines: Layering</a> 
    for more discussion on this pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 align="left">Pattern Name</h5>
<p align="left"><b><i>Blackboard</i></b></p>
<h5 align="left">Context</h5>
<p align="left">A domain in which no closed (algorithmic) approach to solving 
  a problem is known or feasible. Examples are AI systems, voice recognition, 
  and surveillance systems.</p>
<h5 align="left">Problem</h5>
<p align="left">Multiple problem-solving agents (knowledge agents) must cooperate 
  to solve a problem that cannot be solved by any of the individual agents. The 
  results of the work of the individual agents must be accessible to all the other 
  agents so they can evaluate whether they can contribute to finding a solution 
  and post results of their work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Forces</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p align="left">Sequence in which knowledge agents can contribute to solving 
        the problem is not deterministic and may depend on problem solving strategies
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p align="left">Input from different agents (results or partial solutions) 
        may have different representations
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p align="left">Agents do not know of each other's existence directly but 
        can evaluate each other's posted contributions
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h5 align="left">Solution</h5>
<p align="left">A number of Knowledge Agents have access to a shared data store 
  called the Blackboard. The blackboard provides an interface to inspect and update 
  its content. The Control module/object activates the agents following some strategy. 
  Upon activation an agent inspects that blackboard to see if it can contribute 
  to solving the problem. If the agent determines that it can contribute, the 
  control object can allow the agents to put its partial (or final) solution on 
  the board.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Example:</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/blkbd.gif" width="464" height="264"></p>
  <p align="left">This shows the structural or static view modeled using UML.
  This would be part of a parameterized collaboration, which is then bound to
  actual parameters to instantiate the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="Architectural Style">Architectural Style</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A software architecture, or only an architectural view, may have an attribute 
  called <b>architectural style</b>, which reduces the set of possible forms to 
  choose from, and imposes a certain degree of uniformity to the architecture. 
  The style may be defined by a set of patterns, or by the choice of specific 
  components or connectors as the basic building blocks. For a given system, some 
  of the style can be captured as part of the architectural description in an 
  <b>architecture style guide</b>&#151provided 
  through the <a href="../../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">project specific guidelines</a> 
  artifact in the RUP. Style plays a major part in the understandability 
  and integrity of the architecture.</p>
<h3><a name="Architectural Blueprints">Architectural Blueprints</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The graphical depiction of an architectural view is called an <b>architectural
blueprint</b>. For the various views described above, the blueprints are
composed of the following diagrams from the Unified Modeling Language [<a href="../../referenc.htm#UML01">UML01</a>]:
<ul>
  <li><a href="co_lview.htm"><b>Logical view</b></a>. Class diagrams,
    state machines, and object diagrams</li>
  <li><a href="co_pview.htm"><b>Process view</b></a>. Class diagrams
    and object diagrams (encompassing task&#151processes and threads)</li>
  <li><a href="../implemen/co_impvw.htm"><b>Implementation view</b></a>.
    Component diagrams</li>
  <li><a href="co_dview.htm"><b>Deployment view</b></a>. Deployment
    diagrams</li>
  <li><a href="../requirem/co_ucv.htm"><b>Use-case view</b></a>.
    Use-case diagrams depicting use cases, actors, and ordinary design classes;
    sequence diagrams depicting design objects and their collaboration</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="The Architecting Process">The Architecting Process</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In the RUP, the architecture is primarily an outcome of
the <a href="../ovu_and.htm">analysis &amp; design workflow</a>. As the project
reenacts this workflow, iteration after iteration, the architecture evolves,
refined, and polished. As each iteration includes integration and test, the
architecture is quite robust by the time the product is delivered. This
architecture is a main focus of the iterations of the <a href="../../itrwkfls/iwf_iie.htm">elaboration</a>
phase, at the end of which the architecture is normally baselined.</p>
