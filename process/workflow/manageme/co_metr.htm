we Measure? </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>We measure primarily to gain control of a project, and therefore to be able
to manage it. We measure to evaluate how close or far we are from the objectives
we had set in our plan in terms of completion, quality, compliance to
requirements, etc.</p>
<p>We measure also to be able to better estimate for new projects effort, cost
and quality, based on past experience. Finally, we measure to evaluate how we
improve on some key aspects of performance of the process over time, to see what
are the effects of changes.</p>
<p>Measuring some key aspects of a project adds a non-negligible cost. So we do
not measure just anything because we can. We must set very precise goals for
this effort, and only collect metrics that will allow us to satisfy these goals.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of goals:
<ol>
  
  <li><b>Knowledge goals</b>: they are expressed by the use of verbs like
  evaluate, predict, monitor. You want to better understand your development
  process. For example, you may want to assess product quality, obtain data to
  predict testing effort, monitor test coverage, or track requirements changes.</li>
  
  <li><b>Change or achievement goals</b>: these are expressed by the use of
  verbs such as increase, reduce, improve, or achieve. You are usually
  interested in seeing how things change or improve over time, from an iteration
  to another, from a project to another.</li>
</ol>
<p class="exampleheading">Examples</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor progress relative to plan</li>
    <li>Improve customer satisfaction</li>
    <li>Improve productivity</li>
    <li>Improve predictability</li>
    <li>Increase reuse</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These general management goals do not translate readily into metrics. We have
to translate them into some smaller subgoals (or <b>action goals</b>)
which identify the actions project members have to take to achieve the goal. And
we have to make sure that the people involved understand the benefits.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Examples</p>
<p class="example">The goal to<b> &quot;improve customer satisfaction&quot;</b>
would decompose into:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Define customer satisfaction</li>
    <li>Measure customer satisfaction, over several releases</li>
    <li>Verify that satisfaction improves</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">The goal to <b>&quot;improve productivity&quot;</b>
would decompose into:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure effort</li>
    <li>Measure progress</li>
    <li>Calculate productivity over several iterations or projects.</li>
    <li>Compare the results</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">Then some of the subgoals (but not all) would require some
metrics to be collected.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example"><b>&quot;Measure customer satisfaction&quot;</b>
can be derived from</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer survey (where customer would give marks for different aspects)</li>
    <li>Number and severity of calls to a customer support hotline.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>A useful way to categorize these goals is by organization, project and
technical need. This gives a framework for the refinement discussed above.</p>
<h4><a name="Organizational Needs for Metrics">Organizational Needs for Metrics</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>An organization needs to know, and perhaps improve, its costs per &#145;item&#146;,
shorten its build times (time-to market), while delivering product of known
quality (objective and subjective), and appropriate maintenance demands. An
organization may from time to time (or even continuously) need to improve its
performance to remain competitive. To reduce its risks, an organization needs to
know the skill level and experience level of its staff, and ensure it has the
other resources and capability to compete in its chosen sphere. An organization
must be able to introduce new technology and determine the cost-benefit of that
technology. The following table lists some examples of the kinds of metrics that
are relevant to these needs for a software development organization.</p>

<p>This is an extensive, but not exhaustive list, of concerns for the Project
Manager. Many will require the collection and analysis of metrics, some will
also require the development of specific tests (to derive measurements) to
answer the questions posed.</p>
<h4><a name="Technical Needs for Metrics">Technical Needs for Metrics</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Many of the project needs will not have direct measures and even for those
that do, it may not be obvious what should be done or changed to improve them.
Lower level quality-carrying attributes can be used to build in quality against
various higher level quality attributes such as those identified in ISO Standard
9126 (Software Quality Characteristics and Metrics) and those mentioned above in
Project Needs. These technical measures are of engineering (structural and
behavioral) characteristics and effects (covering process and product), that
contribute to project level metrics needs. The attributes in the following table
have been used to derive a sample set of metrics for the Rational Unified
Process artifacts and process.

Metrics</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="What is a metric?">What is a Metric? </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>We distinguish two kinds of metrics:
<ul>
  <li>A <b>metric</b> is a measurable attribute of an entity. For
    example, project effort is a measure (that is, metric) of project size. To be
    able to calculate this metric you would need to sum all the time-sheet
    bookings for the project.</li>
  <li>A <b>primitive metric</b> is a raw data item that is used to
    calculate a metric. In the above example the time-sheet bookings are the
    primitive metrics. A primitive metric is typically a metric that exists in a
    database but is not interpreted in isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each metric is made up of one or more collected metrics. Consequentially each
primitive metric has to be clearly identified and its collection procedure
defined.</p>
<p>Metrics to support change or achievement goals are often
&quot;first-derivative&quot; over time (or iterations or project). We are
interested in a trend, not in the absolute value. To &quot;improve quality&quot;
we need to check that the residual level of known defects diminishes over time.</p>

<h3><a name="Metrics activities">Metrics Activities </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>There are two activities:
<ul>
  <li>Define measurement plan</li>
  <li>Collect measures</li>
</ul>
<p>Define measurement plan is done once per development cycle - in the inception
phase, as part of the general planning activity, or sometimes as part of the
configuration of the process in the development case. The measurement plan may
be revisited like any other section of the software development plan during the
course of the project.</p>
<p>Collect measures is done repetitively, at least once per iteration, and
sometimes more often; for example, weekly on an iteration spanning many months.</p>
<p>The metrics collected are part of the Status Assessment document, to be
exploited in assessing the progress and health of the project. They may also be
accumulated for later use in project estimations and trends over the
organization.</p>
<h4><a name="How are the metrics used?">How are the Metrics Used?</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<h5>Estimation</h5>
<p>The project manager in particular is faced with having to plan – assign
resources to activities with budgets and schedules. Either effort and schedule
are estimated from a judgment of what is to be produced, or the inverse –
there are fixed resources and schedule and an estimate of what can be produced
is needed. Estimation typically has to do with the calculation of resource needs
based on other factors – typically size and productivity – for planning
purposes.</p>
<h5>Prediction</h5>
<p>Prediction is only slightly different from estimation, and is usually about
the calculation of the future value of some factor based on today’s value of
that factor, and other influencing factors. For example, given a sample of
performance data, it is useful to know (predict) from it how the system will
perform under full load, or in a resource constrained or degraded configuration.
Reliability prediction models use defect rate data to predict when the system
will reach certain reliability levels. Having planned an activity, the project
manager will need data on which to predict completion dates and effort at
completion.</p>
<h5>Assessment</h5>
<p>Assessment is used to establish the current position for comparison with a
threshold, say, or identification of trends, or for comparison between
alternatives, or as the basis for estimation or prediction.</p>
