</div>

<p>During the <a href="../itrwkfls/iwf_iii.htm">Inception phase</a>, you should
prepare estimates for the work proposed in the project (for a general discussion
of software project estimation see [<a href="../referenc.htm#BOE81">BOE81</a>],
[<a href="../referenc.htm#PUT92">PUT92</a>], and [<a href="../referenc.htm#MCO96">MCO96</a>]).
Software project estimation is based on some complex mathematics, so detailed
technical background is not discussed here. Estimation follows a four step
process:
<ol>
  <li>Estimate product size.</li>
  <li>Estimate total project effort and cost</li>
  <li>Apply constraints and priorities (for example, number of staff, delivery date,
    budget)</li>
  <li>Select optimum schedule, effort, and cost estimate</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Estimate Product Size</b></h4>
<p>This is the key input to the estimation process. If you can't estimate the
magnitude of work to be done, any project schedule you create is likely to be
far from reality. There are two approaches to estimating the size of the
software product that can be used early in the project: Sizing by Analogy, and
Sizing by Analysis. Of course, later in the project (during the Elaboration
phase) you can prepare more rigorous bottom-up estimates based on a detailed
project Work Breakdown Structure.</p>
<p><b>Sizing by Analogy</b></p>
<p>When you estimate the project scope using the Sizing by Analogy approach you
compare the new product you will be developing with products (of known size)
developed in previous projects. You should compare various characteristics of
the products being compared, such as number of business use cases, number of
actors, database size/complexity, and likely numbers of online and batch
programs.</p>
<p>By comparing these characteristics you can estimate the relative size of the
new product compared to the old ones, then you use the known size of the old
product to calculate the estimated size for the new one. Bear in mind that it is
important to compare products of similar complexity, developed using similar
approaches as variances in such things as the level of detail in use case
descriptions can invalidate your comparisons.</p>
<p><b>Sizing by Analysis</b></p>
<p>Later on in the Inception phase, it is likely that you will have gathered
enough information about the new product to use analytical techniques to
estimate the product size. These techniques rely upon a functional description
of the software product being available (for example, Software Requirements
Specification, Software Architecture Document) and apply standard counting rules
to determine a size measure from these descriptions. Probably the most well
known of these techniques is Function Point Counting, although a number of other
measures have been developed including Feature Points (a modification of
Function Points for application to real-time systems) and Predictive Object
Points (a measure for object-oriented systems based on an analysis of class
complexities and hierarchies).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also white papers available from the <a href="http://www.rational.net/rupcenter" target="_blank">RUP 
  Knowledge Center on RDN<sup><font size="2">SM</font></sup></a>, which describe 
  methods for size estimation based on Use Cases. When using these papers, you 
  should be aware that to make <b>initial</b> size estimations based on Use Cases, 
  you <b>must</b> calibrate to suit your organization's Use Case style, because 
  Use Cases can vary greatly in level of abstraction and manner of expression 
  between organizations, and even within an organization. Once calibrated, it 
  is important to keep to the selected standard style for writing Use Cases, otherwise 
  the size estimates can be wildly erroneous.</p>
<p><b>Estimate Total Project Effort and Costs</b></p>
<p>The total staff effort and schedule for a project can be calculated from the
product size estimate using established scientific models. The two prominent
models in use today are the COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO) developed by <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/Research_Group/barry.html" target="_blank">Barry
Boehm</a>, and Larry Putnam's Putnam Methodology. Both models have been
validated against industry data. For more information on latest version of
COCOMO, see the <a href="http://sunset.usc.edu/COCOMOII/cocomo.html" target="_blank">COCOMOII
web site</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the size input, the other key input is a measure of the team
productivity. This value determines the overall project effort. The total
project schedule is related non-linearly to the total effort. Unfortunately the
models are mathematically complex, so it is best to make use of software tools
to assist with the calculations.</p>
<p><b>Apply Constraints and Priorities</b></p>
<p>Just about every project is subject to some constraints (for example, must ship be a
certain date, or cost cannot exceed $850,000) or priorities (for example, product needed
as soon as possible). Given a fixed product size, these are affected by
adjustments to team size. It turns out that the relationship between team size
and schedule is not linear, so you'll need to use the scientific models to
generate a number of scenarios based on varying team sizes. Automated estimation
software is very useful for this exercise.</p>
<p><b>Select Optimum Schedule, Effort and Cost Estimate</b></p>
<p>Now that you have a range of scenarios for the project, you review and select
the scenario that best fits your project's needs. This gives you an initial
picture of the overall duration of the project as proposed, and indicates the
necessary team size and budget.</p>

<p>The Software Development Plan first defines the dates and nature of the major
milestones (see <a href="../itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">Phases</a>). This part of the
Software Development Plan serves as the overall &quot;road map&quot; to the
project and is created at the beginning of the project (inception phase).</p>
<p>To plan the phases for a project in the initial development cycle, you may
have to make some educated guesses about milestones on the basis of:
<ul>
  <li>Experience with projects similar in nature and domain.</li>
  <li>The degree of novelty.</li>
  <li>Specific environment constraints such as response-time, distribution, and
    safety.</li>
  <li>The maturity of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using estimates based on your own experiences in other projects of a similar
nature, you create the initial project budget by allocating the appropriate
portions of the total estimated effort and costs to each phase of the project.</p>

of iterations, see <a href="../modguide/md_prpln.htm">Guidelines: Software

<p>Once the length of the project phases are determined, the number of
iterations and their length need to be determined.  
For more information on how to define the length of iterations and the number of iterations, 
see <a href="../modguide/md_prpln.htm">Guidelines: Project Plan</a>. There are a number of iteration patterns that can be applied,
depending on the type of project, problem domain and novelty of the problem
domain (see also <a href="../workflow/manageme/co_phase.htm">Concepts: Iteration</a>).</p>
<p>Each iteration produces a deliverable, a release which is an executable
product that is used to assess progress and quality. Because each iteration has
a different focus, the functionality and completeness of the iteration
deliverable will vary. Iteration goals must be specific enough to assess, at the
end of the iteration, whether the iteration goals have been met. In early
iterations, goals are usually expressed in terms of <b>risks mitigated</b>;
in later iterations goals are expressed in measures of functional completion and
quality.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>The Project Close-Out Plan is documented in <i>Section 5.6 Close-out Plan</i>
of the Software Development Plan. Project Close-Out is the series of activities
that are carried out to bring an orderly closure to the project, ensuring that
any metrics and lessons learned are captured for future reference.</p>
<p>The close-out process begins when the following conditions have been met:
<ul>
  <li>All project deliverables have been completed and stored under
    configuration control</li>
  <li>Acceptance testing has been completed and the product has been formally
    accepted by the customer</li>
  <li>The product has been formally delivered/handed over to the customer</li>
</ul>
<h4>Define Close-Out Activities</h4>
<p>Firstly, list in your plan the activities you will perform during project
close-out. Typically these will include the following:
<ul>
  <li>A project post-mortem meeting</li>
  <li>Development of a project post mortem report</li>
  <li>End of project personnel reviews</li>
  <li>Archival of project artifacts</li>
  <li>Re-assignment of project staff</li>
  <li>Addition of project metrics to your organizations historical metrics
    database for future project estimation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Identify Participants for Close-Out Activities</h4>
<p>Next, identify in your plan which individuals will be involved in each of the
close-out activities.</p>
<h4>Define Schedule for Close-Out Activities</h4>
<p>Then, define the schedule for the close-out activities. Usually, this detail
is added to the Software Development Plan towards the end of the project.</p><br>
