<p>Seen from 20,000 feet there is not much that distinguishes a software
architecture assessment from any other assessment or review.</p>
<p>However, one important characteristic of the software architecture is the
lack of specific measurements for many architectural quality attributes&#151;only a
few architectural qualities can be objectively measured. Performance is an
example where measurement is possible. Other qualities are more qualitative or
subjective: conceptual integrity for example. Moreover, it is often hard to
decide what a metric means in absence of other data or reference for comparison.
If a reference system is available and understood by the target audience, it is
often convenient to express some of the results of the review <b>relative</b>
to this reference system. This may happen in a context where the system under
design can be compared to an earlier design.</p>
<p>When in the life-cycle this assessment takes place also affects its purpose
or usefulness.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/ac_rvarc.gif" width="660" height="210"></p>
<ol>
  <li>At the end of the inception phase in an initial development cycle, there 
    is usually little of a concrete architecture in place. But a review may uncover 
    some unrealistic objectives, missing pieces, missed opportunity for reusing 
    existing products, etc.</li>
  <li>The most natural place for a software architecture assessment is at the 
    end of the elaboration phase. This phase is primarily focused on exploring 
    the requirements in details, and baselining an architecture. An architecture 
    review is mandated by our process at this milestone. This is the case where 
    a broad range of architectural qualities are examined.</li>
  <li>More focused assessments may take place during the construction phase to 
    examine specific quality attributes, such as performance or safety, and at 
    the end of the construction phase for any lingering issues that may make the 
    product unfit to be put in the hands of its end-users.</li>
  <li>Damage-control assessments may take place late in the construction or even 
    transition phases, when things have gone really wrong: construction does not 
    complete, or an unacceptable level of problems arise in the installed base 
    during the transition.</li>
  <li>Finally as assessment may take place at the end of the transition phase, 
    in particular to inventory reusable assets for an eventual new product or 
    evolution cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The &quot;peer&quot; reviewer has the same staffing profile as that of the 
  Role: <a href="../workers/wk_archt.htm">Software Architect</a>, although with a more narrow focus on the technical 
  issues. Leadership, maturity, pragmatism, and result-orientation are important 
  to lesser degrees, but still important&#151;a reviewer may uncover architectural 
  defects that are likely to be unpopular if they threaten the schedule of the 
  project. Still, it's better to raise critical issues early, when they can be 
  resolved, rather than blindly following a schedule that leads the project team 
  down the wrong path. The architecture reviewer needs to balance risks against 
  costs, remaining sensitive to the broader issues of project success. The architecture 
  reviewer also needs to be a persuasive communicator who can raise and discuss 
  sensitive issues.<br>

<p>Diverse approaches can be used to do the review:
<ul>
  <li>representation driven</li>
  <li>information driven</li>
  <li>scenario driven</li>
</ul>
<h5>Representation-driven review</h5>
<p>Obtain (or build) a representation of the architecture, then ask questions
and reason based on this representation.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of situations here, from the organization that are very
architecture-literate and will provide some intelligible description to start
with, to organizations where you need to identify who is the software architect (even
hidden under some other name), and need to extract the information from that
person, to the place where software architecture is a totally unknown concept.
This process is then called &quot;mining the architecture,&quot; and in practice
looks literally like that: digging it out the software or its documentation with
a pickax, looking at source code, interfaces, configuration data, etc.</p>
<p>One model that can be used to organize the representation is in the format of
the architectural views presented in the Software Architecture Document: the
logical view organizes the main classes (the object model), the process view
describes the main threads of control and how they communicate, the development
view shows the various subsystems and their dependencies, the physical view
describes the mapping of elements of the other views onto one or several
physical configuration. Organize issues alongside the various views.</p>
<h5>Information-driven review</h5>
<p>Establish the list of information&#151;data, measurements&#151;that is needed for
the reasoning, get the information, and compare this information to either the
requirements or some accepted reference standard. This applies well for
investigating certain quality attributes, such as performance, or robustness.</p>
<h5>Scenario-driven review</h5>
<p>This is the systematic &quot;what if&quot; approach. Transform the general
questions being asked into a set of scenarios the system should go through and
ask questions based on the scenarios. Example of such scenarios are:
<ul>
  <li>The system runs on platforms X and Y. (The real quality attribute probed
    is portability.)</li>
  <li>The system does this (additional) function F. (The real quality attribute
    is extensibility.)</li>
  <li>The system processes 200 requests per hour. (The real quality attribute is
    scalability.)</li>
  <li>The system is being installed on this kind of site by the end user. (The
    real quality attribute is completeness or usability.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of such an approach is that it puts the task in a very concrete
perspective, understandable by all parties. It also allows to probe into
omissions or flaws into the requirements, especially when the requirements are
informal or unwritten or very general and terse. The disadvantage is that it
does not grab the architecture itself as the object being reviewed, but takes
the system as a black box into which we are only sending some probes.</p>
<p>In practice, things are not so clearly separated, and we end up doing a bit
of all three approaches.</p>
<h5>Identifying issues</h5>
<p>Uncovering potential issues is mostly done by human judgment based upon
knowledge and experience. Certain failure patterns are repeated from project to
project, from organization to organization. Certain heuristics can be used to
uncover problem areas. Check-lists can be useful (some very generic ones are
proposed later), as well as results from previous reviews, if any.</p>
<p>Capture <b>potential</b> issues as they appear, describing them in
a neutral tone&#151;no finger pointing, no &quot;catastrophism’. You may use
little cardboard cards as do AT&amp;T reviewers, or as we do with CRC cards, to
help prioritizing, organizing, eliminating.</p>
<p>Later, sort the candidate issues by decreasing scope or impact, and if there
are many, tackle first the ones that are directly related to the question at
hand, leaving the &quot;other suggestions&quot; for later if time permits. Then
assert the reality of the problem: very often one can perceive a problem, but it
may not be. We just have not spoken to the right person, looked at the right
piece of information. Sort again. Ensure multiple data points to verify the
reality of a problem. (Inexperienced assessors tend to be too single-threaded.)</p>
<p>When the problem has been confirmed, rapidly examine what could eliminate the
problem, without necessary trying to do on-the-fly redesign of the system. Write
down potential simplifications, reuse, alternatives: buy vs. build.</p>

coordinate additional investigation of alternatives, or to coordinate the
resolution of the defect if it is far-reaching or broad in scope.</p><br>
