<p>Neither an exclusively top-down approach nor an exclusively bottom-up approach 
  is sufficient for identifying business goals. It is necessary to investigate 
  and synchronize business goals from both perspectives. A combined approach such 
  as the one described here facilitates understanding and helps align the strategic, 
  tactical, and operational levels of the organization.</p>

<h3><a name="Analyze Competitive Positioning">Analyze Competitive Positioning</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3> 

<p>The purpose of this step is to determine the current and desired competitive 
  positioning.&nbsp; The business goals to be defined in the next step will lead 
  the organization to the desired situation. A number of techniques are applicable 
  here—for example, a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis 
  or Porter's competitive analysis [<a
href="../referenc.htm#POR98">POR98</a>].</p>

<p> Without a clear and well-communicated business strategy, realistic business 
  goals cannot be set, and alignment between business goals, processes, and strategy 
  cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h3><a name="Define Business Goals">Define Business Goals<img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3> 
<p>The purpose of this step is to define what needs to be achieved in order for 
  the organization to reach the desired competitive position identified in the 
  previous step. Be sure to focus on what will give the organization a competitive 
  advantage, because only this is strategic, as described in <a href="../modguide/md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Goal</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Describe Measures">Describe Measures<img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3> 

<p>The purpose of this step is to define how the business goal will be measured. 
  If you can find a quantitative measure to assess whether or not the business 
  goal has been achieved, the business goal probably can be related to business 
  activities. Try to quantify the expected outcome and record this in the change 
  value and change kind properties of the business goal. Because people often 
  set more ambitious goals for themselves than others would, it is useful to discuss 
  the upper and lower boundaries with those responsible for achieving the business 
  goal. Employees need to feel that there is enough challenge in their work, but 
  they also like to be able to give themselves an occasional pat on the back.</p>

<p>If the measure is qualitative or subjective, the business goal may need to 
  be translated to more measurable, lower-level goals. In this case, the sub-goals 
  are identified by considering how the higher-level goal will be measured. Achievement 
  of some or all of the sub-goals should result in achievement of the higher-level 
  goal.</p>

<p>If a business goal has been assigned a date by which it should be achieved, 
  it is sufficiently concrete to be called an objective. When determining the 
  timeframe within which the goal is to be achieved, be ambitious yet realistic.</p>

<h3><a name="Trace Business Goals">Structure Business Goals<img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3> 
<p>The purpose of this step is to identify the relationships between higher level 
  and lower level goals. This is the step that will actually produce a hierarchy 
  of business goals. Some business goals are not concrete and measurable enough 
  to allow you to find supporting business use cases. These are typically strategic 
  goals that need to be defined at more concrete levels.</p>
<p>Business goals must be traced from higher level to lower level to produce a 
  business-goal hierarchy.</p>
<p>In the daily operations of any enterprise, there are minor localized conflicts 
  between scoring in the short-term and building up long-term company value. A 
  business-goal hierarchy derived from the Business Vision ensures that the right 
  tradeoffs are made between short-term financial goals and less immediate, yet 
  more important, strategic goals.</p>

<h3><a name="Evaluate Your Results">Evaluate Your Results</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif"alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3> 
<p>The purpose of this step is to verify that the business strategy has been successfully 
  translated into a set of management objectives for the organization. Review 
  the business-goals hierarchy as well as the individual business goals to ensure 
  that they form a complete and consistent whole. Make sure that the business 
  goals have been translated to the business use cases so that the activities 
  of the business are aligned with the desired competitive position of the organization.</p>
<p>Conduct a review session with management and stakeholders at different levels 
  to ensure that the business goals support the strategy and that business goals 
  at different levels are unambiguous, measurable, and realistic. For help with 
  reviewing, see <a href="chklists/ck_bgoal.htm">Checkpoints: Business Goal</a>.</p>
