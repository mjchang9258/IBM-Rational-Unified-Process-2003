</div>
<p>Setup the test environment to ensure that all the required components (hardware, 
  software, tools, data, etc.) have been established, and are available and ready 
  in the test environment in the correct state to enable the tests to be conducted. 
  Typically this will involve some form of basic environment reset (e.g. Registry 
  and other configuration files), restoration of underlying databases to the require 
  state, and the setup of any peripheral devices (e.g. such as loading paper into 
  printers). While some tasks can be performed automatically, some aspects typically 
  require human attention.</p>

<p>The use of environment support tools such as those that enable hard-disk image 
  capture and restoration are extremely valuable in managing this effort effectively.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>Set the execution options of the supporting tools. Depending on the sophistication 
  of the tool, this may be many options to consider. Failing to set these options 
  appropriately may reduce the usefulness and value of the resulting Test Logs 
  and other outputs. Where possible, you should try to store these tool options 
  and settings so that they can be reloaded easily based on one or more predetermined 
  profiles.In the case of automated test execution tools, there may be many different 
  settings to be considered, such as the speed at which execution should be performed.</p>
<p>In the case of manual testing, it is often simply a matter of logging into 
  issue or changes request tracking systems, or partitioning a new unique entry 
  in a support system for logging results. You should give some thought to concerns 
  such as the name, location and state of the Test Log to be written to.</p>

<br></div>
<p>In many cases where test execution can be attended, the Test Suite can be executed 
  relatively on demand. In these cases, scheduling will likely need to take into 
  account considerations such as the work of other testers, other team members 
  as well as different test teams that share the test environment. In these cases, 
  test execution will typically need to work around infrequent environment resets.</p>
<p>However, in cases where unattended execution of automated tests is desired, 
  or where the execution of many tests running concurrently on different machines 
  must be coordinated, some form of automated scheduling mechanism may be required. 
  Either use the features of your automated test execution tool or develop your 
  own utility functions to enable the required scheduling.</p>

<a href="#RecoverHaltedTests"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Recover Halted Tests" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Inspect the Test Logs and other output for completeness and accuracy. Identify 
  where errors have occurred and inspect them.</p>

<p>When test automation is being employed, there are two categories of halted 
  tests that it is important to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fatal errors - the system fails (network failures, hardware crashes, etc.)</li>
  <li>Test failures - this is when some part of a Test within a 
    Test Suite cannot be executed as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>When either category of abnormal behavior occurs during test execution, they 
  may exhibit the following symptoms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a large number of (ongoing occurrence) of unexpected actions, unexpected 
    windows occuring while the Test Suite is executing</li>
  <li>the test environment appears unresponsive, is slow or is in an undesirable 
    state (such as hung or crashed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Work through the symptoms until you can determine the root cause of the problem.</p>


<h4><a name="CorrectErrors">Correct errors</a>
<a href="#RecoverHaltedTests"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Recover Halted Tests" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Errors may be found in the input data consumed by the test, the test itself 
  or other aspects of the test such as the test environment or runtime tool settings. 
  It's common for a fix to an error in one aspect of the test to require the correct 
  state to be present in all often aspects of the test.</p>
<p>Once you have finished investigating problems, you may have discovered one 
  or more faults that needs correction. To make permanent corrections to the environment, 
  test data or the test itself, it is a good practice to restore each aspect of 
  the test again to a known state before applying any permanent corrections. This 
  ensures that no additional unwanted or invalid changes find their way into the 
  known-state environment. </p>
<p>After making the necessary changes, save the Test and backup or save the accompanying 
  input data and test environment as required.</p>

<a href="#RecoverHaltedTests"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Recover Halted Tests" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Reschedule and re-execute the Test Suite. Depending on what recovery process 
  is available (if any), you may be able to restart the test suite from an interim 
  point rather than starting from the beginning. Note that to enable recovery 
  of test execution from a point part-way through the test run, typically necessitates 
  the implementation and ongoing maintenance of some form of partial recovery 
  procedure.</p>

<p>When test execution initially completes, the Test Logs should be reviewed to 
  ensure that the logs are reliable and reported failures, warnings, or unexpected 
  results were not caused by external influences (to the target-of-test), such 
  as improper environment setup or invalid input data for the test.</p>
<p>For GUI-driven automated Tests, common Test failures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Test verification failures</b> - this occurs when the actual result and 
    the expected result do not match. Verify that the verification method(s) used 
    focus only on the essential items and / or properties and modify if necessary.</li>
  <li><b>Unexpected GUI windows</b> - this occurs for several reasons. The most 
    common is when a GUI window other than the expected one is active or the number 
    of displayed GUI windows is greater than expected. Ensure that the test environment 
    has been setup and initialized as intended for proper test execution.</li>
  <li><b>Missing GUI windows</b> - this failure is noted when a GUI window is 
    expected to be available (but not necessarily active) and is not. Ensure that 
    the test environment has been setup and initialized as intended for proper 
    test execution. Verify that the actual missing windows are / were removed 
    from the target-of-test.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the reported failures are due to errors identified in the test artifacts, 
  or due to problems with the test environment, the appropriate corrective action 
  should be taken and the testing re-executed.
<br>(See: <a href="ac_tst_anltstflr.htm">Activity: 
  Analyze Test Failure</a>).

</p>
<p>If the Test Log enables you to determine that the failures are due to genuine 
  failures in the Target Test Items, then the execution portion of the activity 
  is complete.</p>

<p>Using the Traceability requirements outlined in the Test Plan, update the traceability

  in terms of measuring the extent of testing or test coverage. As a general rules, 
  we recommend basing the measurement of the extent of testing against the motivators 
  you discovered during the test planning activities.</p>
<p>Test Suites might also be traced to the defined Test Cases they realize. They 
  may also be traced to elements of the requirements, software specification, 
  design or implementation.</p>
<p>Whatever relationships you have decided are important to trace, you will need 
  to update the status of the relationships that were established during implementation 
  of the Test Suite.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
