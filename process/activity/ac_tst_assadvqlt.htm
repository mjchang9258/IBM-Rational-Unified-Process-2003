<br>
</div>

<p>Begin by examining the Test Evaluation Summaries that the test team has prepared. 
  Compare the evaluation information to the Test Plan for the iteration to understand 
  the summary in the context of the planned work. Raise any ambiguities and concerns 
  with the test team members who prepared the summary and resolve them.</p>
<p>For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and 
  assessing the software quality, try to obtain a balanced view incorporating 
  both objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only 
  give part of the picture and need to be supported and explained by the current 
  project &quot;climate&quot;. Conversely, don't rely purely on hearsay and subjective 
  speculation about the software quality: look for supporting objective evidence. 
  We recommend you supplement your objective data by discussion with either team 
  leads or where possible individual team members to gather subjective assessments 
  and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.</p>

<p>Based on the Test Evaluation Summaries, examine selected Test Results for additional 
  context. Research the results enough to feel confident you understand the important 
  issues that have been identified in the Test Evaluation Summaries.</p>
<p>Also review the data yourself and look for important trends evident in the 
  Test Results data that may have been missed. In general it's more important 
  to identify what the relative trends in the data are indicating rather than 
  looking at absolute numbers. Be on the lookout for indications such as failures 
  in one areas that relate to failures in others.</p>


<h3><a name="UnderstandDefectTop10">Examine key Change Requests</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

    </tr>

</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>We recommend you limit this exercise to the most pressing Issues and associated 
  Change Requests. You'll be able to devote more energy to a smaller number of 
  issues, and they are often more likely to have the most impact on product quality. 
  If you have a longer list of key issues, we recommend you devote appropriate 
  effort to them based on their relative priority: don't waste your resources 
  by championing the least significant issue. However, note that a significant 
  number of outstanding lower-priority Change Requests can make as significant 
  a statement about the products quality as a handful of high-priority changes. 
  Try to group lower-priority Change Requests into logical aspects of quality 
  based on the quality risk the represent. This will help you articulate and advocate 
  their combined effect on quality more clearly.</p>
<p>Identify important trends evident in the general Change Request data. In general 
  it's more important to identify what the relative trends in the data are indicating 
  rather than looking at absolute numbers. Look for positive signs such as a steady, 
  continuous rate of defect resolution, or a gradual ongoing increase and subsequent 
  decrease in resolution rate over time. Be on the lookout for sharp peaks and 
  troughs in resolution rate that indicate the development team may be encountering 
  process, environmental, political or other problems that are reducing their 
  productivity.</p>
<p>Note: you may also want to take the opportunity improve the clarity of the 
  associated Change Requests, eliminating ambiguity and emotive language and reasoning. 
  If you make these changes yourself, discuss your improvements with the individuals 
  who originally created these artifacts so that they can understand why the improvements 
  are important.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>For each key gap in quality, consider potential mitigation and contingency 
  strategies. Formulate your initial ideas for these and discuss them informally 
  with other team members to gain greater insight and validate your thoughts. 
  In the case of solutions, it's good to have options: they help you weigh up 
  the tradeoffs and take the best solution for the given context.</p>
<p>Work toward a set of useful candidate solutions and suggestions that will aid 
  the project team in suitably addressing each quality gap. It's important for 
  you to do this so that the test effort is recognized as contributing helpfully 
  to problem resolution: not simply reporting problems. This is an important aspect 
  of advocating the value of the test team and gaining respect and cooperation 
  from other team members.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>It's no fun to back a lost cause. It's usually a more effective approach to 
  identify solutions to problems that the project team are more likely to get 
  behind, accept and commit to achieving. Keep a close relationship with key decision 
  makers, and consider starting by making these key issues visibly informally 
  through one-on-one discussion. Often that's a great way to win support, and 
  find achievable solutions.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't have any choice but to back a solution that is unpopular 
  with the development team. Where this looks likely, it's even more important 
  to know who you can expect support form and find ways to sell the solution that 
  present it's value as clearly as possible or explain clearly the worse situation 
  that will arise by not resolving the problem.</p>

</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>This is the crux of quality advocacy: being able to negotiate a suitable solution 
  that both appeases the development team and does not significantly reduce the 
  quality of the product. Remember that in most cases the test team primarily 
  an advisor about quality, so you must be careful not to demand a given resolution 
  being taken.</p>
<p>However, it's important that the test team does a good job as an advocate for 
  quality and that includes sometimes being the bearer of news the project team 
  would really not like to hear. This is where good test teams provide the development 
  effort with as much insight into the problem, it's potential solutions and as 
  understanding as the tradeoff's for each choice as possible. You should act 
  to some extent as an agent for the eventual customers of the product and help 
  negotiate solutions that will be in their best interest.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Sometimes Defects and other Change Requests get lost in a sea of ongoing basic 
  product development and feature expansion. This is partly because it's more 
  attractive for developers to work on &quot;new stuff&quot; than it is to fix 
  old and buggy code, and partly because business-value can be more obviously 
  placed on adding something new than fixing something broken. As quality advocates, 
  the test team needs to help the project see important defect fixes through to 
  completion.</p>
<p>Successful software teams find a good balance between incremental quality improvement 
  through defect resolution and incremental feature expansion. The test team can 
  assist the project team by finding ways to encourage and support incremental 
  quality improvement rather than taking less helpful and more adversarial &quot;quality 
  police&quot; role.</p>

<p>Whatever solution the development team decide on to resolve a quality issue,

  to assess the improvement in quality brought by a given resolution and that 
  it both addresses the original issue and does not adversely impact quality in 
  other ways.</p>
<p>For solutions that carry some level of risk themselves, it may be useful to 
  conduct some testing of an early release candidate before too much time and 
  effort is devoted to following the resolution to it's conclusion.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
