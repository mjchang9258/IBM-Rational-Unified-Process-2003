<p>In order to choose the most efficient path through business modeling, you
need to understand the current state of the target organization in terms of its
people, processes, and tools. The goal of this activity is to understand problem
areas and improvement potentials, as well as any information on external issues
such as competitors, or trends in the market. When this activity is complete,
you should know:
<ul>
  <li>The current state of the target organization.</li>
  <li>What kind of people there are, their levels of competence, skills, and
    motivation.</li>
  <li>Which business tools are currently used in the target organization.</li>
  <li>To what level current business processes are described and followed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What areas have the best improvement potential.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The reasons for assessing the current state is so you can:
<ul>
  <li>Choose which business-modeling scenario (see <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_scobm.htm">Concepts:
    Scope of Business Modeling</a>) to follow.</li>
  <li>Identify which areas should be considered first. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Motivate why you need to change (if you need to change) process, tools,
    and people in the target organization.</li>
  <li>Create motivation and a common understanding among the people in the
    target organization that will be directly or indirectly affected by the
    changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This activity is only adding value if you are doing business modeling in
order to <a href="../glossary.htm#business_engineering">engineer your business</a>.
If you are only building a chart of an existing organization in order to derive
system requirements, a full assessment is not necessary. See also <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_scobm.htm">Concepts:
Scope of Business Modeling</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Initiate an Assessment">Initiate an Assessment</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>It is recommended that you initiate the assessment with a workshop where you
gather the key stakeholders (known at that time). The primary purposes of such
an initial workshop is to make the business analysts meet the stakeholders of
the business-modeling effort, and to gather a comprehensive list of problems
from stakeholders of the project. See <a href="../workguid/wg_assws.htm">Work
Guidelines: Assessment Workshop</a>, for details on how to conduct such an
initial workshop.</p>
<h3><a name="Identify the Stakeholders">Identify the Stakeholders</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify the stakeholders to the business-modeling effort. Identify
stakeholders outside the target organization, such as:
<ul>
  <li>Customers. Who are the customers? What requirements do customers have on
    the products, in terms of time-to-market, features, security, robustness and
    safety, and complexity.</li>
  <li>Competitors. Who are the competitors? In which areas are the competitors
    strong? What can be learned from competitors?</li>
  <li>Other stakeholders. Are their any other stakeholders involved? Are
    suppliers and partners involved? Are relationships with them a problem? Are
    there people with strong influence and opinions that need to be kept in the
    loop to avoid surprises?</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify stakeholders within the target organization, such as:
<ul>
  <li>Project managers</li>
  <li>Sales people</li>
  <li>Customer representatives</li>
  <li>Marketing people</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask each stakeholder (representatives) what his or her expectations are on
the target organization. This can be done either as part of and assessment
workshop, or in the form of a questionnaire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interview people to understand their attitudes towards change. If people are
negative or skeptic towards the change it is impossible to succeed with the
change, unless you can turn the negative attitudes into positive.</p>
<p>You must analyze and quantify your customers’ present and future
expectations. Do not make assumptions about customer expectations&#151;get the
information from the customers. You can either interview the customer, more or
less formally, or you can use other market-research techniques, such as
telemarketing.</p>
<h3><a name="Describe the Structure of the Target Organization">Describe the
Structure of the Target Organization</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Describe briefly the structure of the organization, the roles, and teams they
currently have. Also look at the relationship between different parts of the
target organization. For example, what is the relationship between sales and
maintenance; or between product development and sales?</p>
<p>It may be inviting to use the business-modeling notation to present this
information, but it is often better to use whatever description style the
stakeholders are accustomed to, be it text, 'org charts', or the Unified
Modeling Language.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Identify Key Persons">Identify Key Persons</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify any key persons in the target organization. A
key person is a person who has one or several of the following characteristics:
<ul>
  <li>Has the &quot;ear of the masses&quot;.</li>
  <li>Can act as mentor.</li>
  <li>Is an expert in some area(s).</li>
  <li>Is opposed to the business-modeling effort.</li>
  <li>Is responsible for the budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>To succeed with a business-engineering effort it is important to have the key
persons on board. You will need to involve them:
<ul>
  <li>During the rest of the assessment to gather information.</li>
  <li>As experts to help identify changes to the target organization.</li>
  <li>To contribute in a pilot project, then be mentor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice: Watch out for people that want to discuss
principles of business modeling, rather than implement an effective new
organization.</p>
<h3><a name="Assess Business Idea and Business Strategy">Assess Business Idea
and Business Strategy</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Most organizations have their business idea and strategy well documented. In
the case where you are documenting &quot;virtual&quot; target organization
(meaning that you are doing business modeling to understand the business
processes of your target customers in order to build better products), this step
could be excluded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explore the strategy to assess:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether current processes are in line with the strategy.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Whether it is concrete enough to be understood by the people working in
    the organization.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Whether it is measurable.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If it is perceived as realistic.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="../modguide/md_torg.htm">Guidelines: Target-Organization
Assessment</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Benchmark">Benchmark</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Determine the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who to benchmark. If you are aiming at a detailed benchmarking effort, you
    would look for non-competitors, but still with sufficient
    similarities.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What metrics to use for benchmarking. Relevant metrics are often a
    combination of time, cost and quality.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How to perform the benchmarking - is it a partnership with another
    organization, or will it be enough to look for public information?</li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="../modguide/md_torg.htm">Guidelines: Target-Organization
Assessment</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Measure Target Organization">Measure Target Organization</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p align="left">Measuring an organization is about understanding its business
processes and measure them. You need to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Define a set of metrics to use that are a good mix of
    customer perceived metrics (such as delivery punctuality) and internally
    perceived metrics (such as production costs).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Determine who to collect metrics from.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Define effect means of collecting the metrics - it has to be
    easy and as little &quot;intrusive&quot; as possible, otherwise people will
    not consider themselves having time to give it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">See <a href="../modguide/md_torg.htm">Guidelines:
Target-Organization Assessment</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Identify the Underlying Reasons for Change">Identify the Underlying
Reasons for Change</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Ask the stakeholders why they want to change their business processes and
business tools. The following are some typical answers, and the effect they have
on how you choose to explore and introduce the business processes:
<ul>
  <li>&quot;We want to use this new technology and need to know how it affects
    our way of working.&quot;<br>
    An example could be a company that has decided to build an e-commerce
    web-site. The least controversial way of approaching this is in many cases
    to consider the changes as a new line of business, rather than a change of
    an existing set of business processes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;We need to make our business processes more effective to meet the
    competition.&quot;<br>
    In this case you need to ask some follow on questions to understand to what
    degree you need to become more efficient - are we talking about minor
    improvements, or about major rework and lots of new kinds of technology
    support. You also need to understand who those competitors are, and what
    kind of metrics is used to compare.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;Our old legacy systems are breaking in the seams and we need to
    replace them before they burst.&quot; This also requires some follow-on
    questions to understand whether there is an expectation the business
    processes will change or not. If not, the approach is often to perform some
    high-level business modeling to get a map of the current organization,
    sometimes a domain model may suffice.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Estimate the Capacity for Change">Estimate the Capacity for Change</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Analyze the capacity for change in the target organization. Organizations
just like individuals can accommodate change but only within a limited range.
Some organizations are better prepared for change than others are. To understand
the organizational capacity for change we recommend that you interview the
people in the organization, to understand the attitudes, and willingness to
change.</p>
<p>Factors to consider are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether there is a weariness of current conditions - the risk then is that
    any suggested change is perceived as being for the better and not properly
    questioned.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Whether there is a weariness of change - the organization may have gone
    through several reorganizations for various reasons that were not perceived
    as successful by the stakeholders. In this case any suggested changes need
    to be made rather concrete and be well motivated in order for people working
    in the organization to even consider whether they are of any value. It is
    also of value to explore why previous change efforts where not successful.</li>
  <li>What are the general attitudes among people working in the target
    organization. Are they &quot;young and hungry&quot; or &quot;experienced and
    settled&quot;?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Whether the target organization is an existing one, or whether it is
    something intended to be build from scratch. If the latter, you need to
    understand the intended capabilities of people in the new organization, and
    how much of ramp-up time it would be possible to give them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In additions to the soft factors mentioned above, you should also assess the
readiness for any new technologies, such as those needed to build an e-business
solution. Examples of such technologies are [<a href="../referenc.htm#CONA99">CONA99</a>]:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Client/server.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Database management.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Programming languages, such as HTML, XML, Java.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Scripted server pages and servlets, such as Microsoft's
    Active Server Pages, Java Server Pages.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Object communication protocols, such as OMG's Common Object
    Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), the Java standard Remote Method
    Invocation (RMI), or Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Components, such as Microsoft's ActiveX/COM.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Web applications frameworks, such as IBM's WebSphere or
    Microsoft's Windows DNA.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assessment will strongly influence the level of risks you should be
willing to take when forming the architecture of your solution, see also <a href="../workflow/manageme/wfs_eval.htm">Workflow
Detail: Evaluate Project Scope and Risk</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Identify Problems">Identify Problems</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The best way to identify problems is to gather a number of key people for a
problem-identification session. See <a href="../workguid/wg_brnst.htm">Work
Guidelines: Brainstorming and Idea Reduction</a>, for general advice on how to
organize such a session.</p>
<p>Ask questions such as:
<ul>
  <li>What are the problems in the target organization?</li>
  <li>Is there a perception that something is broken?</li>
  <li>Are projects routinely behind schedule or over budget?</li>
  <li>What problems do they have?</li>
  <li>Have any metrics been collected that can be analyzed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify what <b>negative effects </b>each problem has, or will
have, if it is not eliminated or reduced, for the projects. To know the effect
of a problem helps you understand how critical it is to eliminate or reduce the
problem.</p>
<p>Identify <b>root causes</b> of each problem. To know the root
causes of a problem helps you understand how to remove or reduce the problem,
and how much it will cost. <a href="../workguid/wg_fish.htm">Fishbone diagrams </a>may
be of help. If there are several root causes to a problem you need to weigh them
against each other, in which case <a href="../workguid/wg_paret.htm">Pareto
diagrams</a> may be of help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: It is very common to rush headlong into defining the solution,
rather than taking time to first understand the problem. Write down the problem,
and see if you can get everyone to agree on the definition.</p>
<p>Rank the problems with respect to the effect they cause. For example, use a
1-to-5-scale, where 5 is for problems with the most dangerous effect, and 1 is
for harmless problems. The primary purpose is to understand the relative
importance of the problems.</p>
<p>One of the simplest ways to gain agreement on the definition
of the problem, is to write it down and see if everyone agrees. List the
problems in a table:</p>
<div align="left">

and issues to focus on. Issues that should be addressed early usually fall into
one or several of the following categories:
<ul>
  <li>Major problem areas. Areas where you can improve the performance of the
    business processes a lot.</li>
  <li>Areas where you can make short-term profits. Areas where you can show fast
