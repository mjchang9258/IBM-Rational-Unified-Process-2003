<p>Select the most appropriate technique to implement the test. For each test 
  that you want to conduct, consider implementing at least one Test Script. In 
  some instances, the implementation for a given test will span multiple Test 
  Scripts. In others, a single Test Script will provide the implementation for 
  multiple tests. </p>
<p>Typical methods for implementing tests include writing a textual description 
  in the form of a script to be followed (for manual testing) and the programming, 
  captured-recording or generation of a script-based programming language (for 
  automated testing). Each method is discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>As with most approaches, we recommend you'll get more useful results if you 
  use a mixture of the following techniques. While you don't need to use them 
  all, you shouldn't confine yourself to using a single technique either.</p>

<h4><a name="ManualTestScripts">Manual Test Scripts</a> <a href="#SelectImplementTechnique"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Select Implement Technique" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Many tests are best conducted manually, and you should avoid the trap of attempting 
  to inappropriately automate tests. Usability tests are an area where manual 
  testing is in many cases a better solution than an automated one. Also tests 
  that require validation of the accuracy and quality of the physical outputs 
  from a software system generally require manual validation. As a general heuristic, 
  it's a good idea to begin the first tests of a particular Target Test Item with 
  a manual implementation; this approach allows the tester to learn about the 
  target item, adapt to unexpected behavior from it, and apply human judgment 
  to determine the next appropriate action to be taken.</p>
<p>Sometimes manually conducted tests will be subsequently automated and reused 
  as part of a regression testing strategy. Note however that it isn't necessary 
  or desirable&#151;or even possible&#151;to automate every test that you could 
  otherwise conduct manually. Automation brings certain advantages in speed and 
  accuracy of test execution, visibility and collation of detailed test outcomes 
  and in efficiency of creating and maintaining complex tests, but like all useful 
  tools, it isn't the solution to all your needs.</p>
<p>Automation comes with certain disadvantages: these basically amount to an absence 
  of human judgment and reasoning during test execution. The automation solutions 
  currently available simply don't have the cognitive abilities that a human does&#151;and 
  it's arguably unlikely that they ever will. During implementation of a manual 
  test, human reasoning can be applied to the observed responses of the system 
  to stimulus. Current automated test techniques and their supporting tools typically 
  have limited ability to notice the implications of certain system behaviors, 
  and have minimal ability to infer possible problems through deductive reasoning.</p>

<h4><a name="ProgramTestScripts">Programmed Test Scripts</a> <a href="#SelectImplementTechnique"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Select Implement Technique" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Arguably the method of choice practiced by most testers who use test automation. 
  In it's purest form, this practice is performed in the same manner and using 
  the same general principles as software programming. As such, most methods and 
  tools used for software programming are generally applicable and useful to test 
  automation programming.</p>
<p>Using either a standard software development environment (such as Microsoft 
  Visual Studio or IBM Visual Age) or a specialized test automation development 
  environment (such as the IDE provided with Rational Robot), the tester is free 
  to harness the features and power of the development environment to best effect.</p>
<p>The negative aspects of programming automated tests are related to the negative 
  aspects of programming itself as a general technique. For programming to be 
  effective, some consideration should be given to appropriate design: without 
  this the implementation will likely fail. If the developed software will likely 
  be modified by different people over time&#151;the usual situation&#151;then 
  some consideration must be given to adopting a common style and form to be used 
  in program development, and ensuring it's correct use. Arguably the two most 
  important concerns relate to the misuse of this technique.</p>
<p>First, there is a risk that a tester will become engrossed in the features 
  of the programming environment, and spend too much time crafting elegant and 
  sophisticated solutions to problems that could be achieved by simpler means. 
  The result is that the tester wastes precious time on what are essentially programming 
  tasks to the detriment of time that could be spent actually testing and evaluating 
  the Target Test Items. It requires both discipline and experience to avoid this 
  pitfall.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the risk that the program code used to implement the test 
  will itself have bugs introduced through human error or omission. Some of these 
  bugs will be easy to debug and correct in the natural course of implementing 
  the automated test: others won't. Just as errors can be elusive to detect in 
  the Target Test Item, it can be equally difficult to detect errors in test automation 
  software. Furthermore, errors may be introduced where algorithms used in the 
  automated test implementation are based on the same faulty algorithms used by 
  the software implementation itself. This results in errors going undetected, 
  hidden by the false security of automated tests that apparently execute successfully. 
  Mitigate this risk by using different algorithms in the automated tests wherever 
  possible.</p>

<h4><a name="RecordTestScripts">Recorded or captured Test Scripts</a> <a href="#SelectImplementTechnique"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Select Implement Technique" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>There are a number of test automation tools that provide the ability to record 
  or capture human interaction with a software application and produce a basic 
  Test Script. There are a number of different tool solutions for this. Most tools 
  produce a Test Script implemented in some form of a high-level, normally editable, 
  programming language. The most common designs work in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by capturing the interaction with the client <i><a href="../glossary.htm#ui" target="_blank">UI</a></i> 
    of an application based on intercepting the inputs sent from the client hardware 
    peripheral input devices: mouse, keyboard and so forth to the client operating 
    system. In some solutions, this is done by intercepting high-level messages 
    exchanged between the operating system and the device driver that describe 
    the interactions in a somewhat meaningful way; in other solutions this is 
    done by capturing low-level messages, often based at the level of time-based 
    movements in mouse coordinates or key-up and key-down events.</li>
  <li>by intercepting the messages sent and received across the network between 
    the client application and one or more server applications. The successful 
    interpretation of those messages relies typically on the use of standard, 
    recognized messaging protocols, such as <i><a href="../glossary.htm#http" target="_blank">HTTP</a></i>, <i><a href="../glossary.htm#sql" target="_blank">SQL</a></i> and so forth. Some 
    tools also allow the capture of &quot;base&quot; communications protocols 
    such as <i><a href="../glossary.htm#tcp/ip" target="_blank">TCP/IP</a></i>, however it can be more complex to work with Test Scripts of 
    this nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these techniques are generally useful to include as part of your approach 
  to automated testing, some practitioners feel these techniques have limitations. 
  One of the main concerns is that some tools simply capture application interaction 
  and do nothing else. Without the additional inclusion of observation points 
  that capture and compare system state during subsequent script execution, the 
  basic Test Script cannot be considered to be a fully-formed test. Where this 
  is the case, the initial recording will need to be subsequently augmented with 
  additional custom program code to implement observation points within the Test 
  Script.</p>
<p>Various authors have published books and essays on this and other concerns 
  related to using test procedure record or capture as a test automation technique. 
  To gain a more in-depth understanding of these issues, we recommend reviewing 
  the work available on the Internet by the following authors:

<p>Some of the more sophisticated test automation software enables the actual 
  generation of various aspects of the test&#151;either the procedural aspects 
  or the Test Data aspects of the Test Script&#151;based on generation algorithms. 
  This type of automation can play a useful part in your test effort, but shouldn't 
  be considered a sufficient approach by itself. The Rational TestFactory tool 
  and the Rational TestManager datapool generation feature are example implementations 
  of this type of technology.</p>

<p>Setup the test environment to ensure that all the needed components (hardware, 
  software, tools, data, etc.) have been implemented and are in the test environment, 
  ready in the correct state to enable the tests to be conducted. Typically this 
  will involve some form of basic environment reset (e.g. resetting the <i><a href="../glossary.htm#windows_registry" target="_blank"> 
  Windows registry</a></i> and other configuration files), restoration of underlying 
  databases to known state, and so forth in addition to tasks such as loading 
  paper into printers. While some tasks can be performed automatically, some aspects 
  typically require human attention.</p>

<h4><a name="ManualCheck">(Optional) Manual walk-through of the test</a>
   <a href="#Setup"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Setup" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Especially applicable to automated Test Scripts, it can be beneficial to initially 
  walk-through the test manually to confirm expected prerequisites are present. 
  During the walk-through, you should verify the integrity of the environment, 
  the software and the test design. The walk-through is most relevant where you 
  are using an interactive recording technique, and least relevant where you are 
  programming the Test Script. The objective is to verify that all the elements 
  required to implement the test successfully are present.</p>
<p>Where the software is known to be sufficiently stable or mature, you way elect 
  to skip this step where you deem the risk of problems occurring in the areas 
  the manual walk-through addresses are relatively low.</p>


<h4><a name="ConfirmTestOracles">Identify and confirm appropriateness of Test 
  Oracles</a> <a href="#Setup"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Setup" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Confirm that the <i><a href="../glossary.htm#test_oracle" target="_blank">Test 
  Oracles</a></i> you plan to use are appropriate. Where they have not already 
  been identified, now is the time for you to do so.</p>
<p>You should try to confirm through alternative means that the chosen Test Oracle(s) 
  will provide accurate and reliable results. For example, if you plan to validate 
  test results using a field displayed via the application's UI that indicates 
  a database update has occurred, consider independently querying the back-end 
  database to verify the state of the corresponding records in the database. Alternatively, 
  you might ignore the results presented in an update confirmation dialog, and 
  instead confirm the update by querying for the record through an alternative 
  front-end function or operation.</p>


<h4><a name="ResetEnvTools">Reset test environment and tools</a>
   <a href="#Setup"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Setup" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Next you should restore the environment&#151;including the supporting tools&#151;back 
  to it's original state. As mentioned in previous steps, this will typically 
  involve some form of basic operating environment reset, restoration of underlying 
  databases to a known state, and so forth in addition to tasks such as loading 
  paper into printers. While some reset tasks can be performed automatically, 
  some aspects typically require human attention.</p>
<p>Set the implementation options of the test-support tools, which will vary depending 
  on the sophistication of the tool. Where possible, you should consider storing 
  the option settings for each tool so that they can be reloaded easily based 
  on one or more predetermined profiles. In the case of manual testing, it will 
  include tasks such as partitioning a new entry in a support system for logging 
  the test results, or signing into an issue and change request logging system.</p>
<p>In the case of automated test implementation tools, there may be many different 
  settings to be considered. Failing to set these options appropriately may reduce 
  the usefulness and value of the resulting test assets.</p>

<p>Using the Test-Ideas List, or one or more selected Test Case artifacts, begin 
  to implement the test. Start by giving the test a uniquely identifiable name 
  (if it does not already have one) and prepare the IDE, capture tool, spreadsheet 
  or document to begin recording the specific steps of the test. Work through 
  the following subsections as many times as are required to implement the test.</p>
<p>Note that for some specific tests or types of tests, there may be little value 
  in documenting the explicit steps required to conduct the test. In certain styles 
  of <i><a href="../glossary.htm#exploratory_testing" target="_blank">exploratory 
  testing</a></i> repetition of the test is not an expected deliverable. For very 
  simple tests, a brief description of the purpose of the tests will be sufficient 
  in many cases to allow it to be reproduced.</p>

<h4><a name="NavigationActions">Implement navigation actions</a> <a href="#ImplementTest"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>Program, record or generate the required navigation actions. Start by selecting 
  your appropriate navigation method of choice. For most classes of system these 
  days, a &quot;Mouse&quot; or other pointing device is the preferred and primary 
  medium for navigation. For example, the pointing and scribing device used with 
  a Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) is conceptually equivalent to a Mouse.</p>
<p>The secondary navigation means is generally that of keyboard interaction. In 
  most cases, navigation will be made up of a combination of mouse-driven and 
  keyboard-driven actions.</p>
<p>In some cases, you will need to consider voice-activated, light, visual and 
  other forms of recognition. These can be more troublesome to automate tests 
  against, and may require the addition of special test-interface extensions to 
  the application to allow audio and visual elements to be loaded and processed 
  from file rather than captured dynamically.</p>
<p>In some situations, you may want to&#151;or need to&#151;perform the same test 
  using multiple navigation methods. There are different approaches you can take 
  to achieve this, for example: automate all the tests using one method and manually 
  perform all or some subset of the tests using others; separate the navigation 
  aspects of the tests from the Test Data that characterize the specific test, 
  providing and building a logical navigation interface that allows either method 
  to be selected to drive the test; simply mix and match navigation methods.</p>


<h4><a name="ObservationPoint">Implement observation points</a> <a href="#ImplementTest"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>At each point in the Test Script where an observation should be taken, use 
  the appropriate Test Oracle to capture the desired information. In many cases, 
  the information gained from the observation point will need to be recorded and 
  retained to be referenced during subsequent control points.</p>
<p>Where this is an automated test, decide how the observed information should 
  be reported from the Test Script. In most cases it usually appropriate simply 
  to record the observation in a central Test Log relative to it's delta-time 
  from the start of the Test Script; in other cases specific observations might 
  be output separately to a spreadsheet or data file for more sophisticated uses.</p>


<h4><a name="ControlPoint">Implement control points</a> <a href="#ImplementTest"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>At each point in the Test Script where a control decision should be taken, 
  obtain and assess the appropriate information to determine the correct branch 
  for the flow of control to follow. The data retrieved form prior observation 
  points are usually input to control points.</p>
<p>Where a control point occurs, and a decision made about the next action in 
  the flow-of-control, we recommend you record the input values to the control 
  point, and the resulting flow that is selected in the Test Log.</p>


<h4><a name="ResolveImplementErrors">Resolve errors in the test implementation</a> 
  <a href="#ImplementTest"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 

<p>During test implementation, you'll likely introduce errors in the test implementation 
  itself. Those errors may even be the result of things you've omitted from the 
  test implementation or may be related to things you've failed to consider in 
  the test environment. These errors will need to be resolved before the test 
  can be considered completely implemented. Identify each error you encounter 
  and work through addressing them.</p>
<p>In the case of test automation that uses a programming language, this might 
  include compilation errors due to undeclared variables and functions, or invalid 
  use of those functions. Work your way through the error messages displayed by 
  the compiler or any other sources of error messages until the Test Script is 
  free of syntactical and other basic implementation errors.</p>
<p>Note that during subsequent execution of the test, other errors in the test 
  implementation might be found. Initially these may appear to be failures in 
  the target test item - you need to be diligent when analyzing test failures

<p>In many cases it's more appropriate to maintain your Test Data external to 
  the Test Script. This provides flexibility, simplicity and security in Test 
  Script and Test Data maintenance. External data sets provide value to test in 
  the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test Data is external to the Test Script eliminating hard-coded references 
    in the Test Script</li>
  <li>External Test Data can be modified easily, usually with minimal Test Script 
    impact</li>
  <li>Additional Test Cases can easily be supported by the Test Data with little 
    or no Test Script modifications</li>
  <li>External Test Data can be shared with many Test Scripts</li>
  <li>Test Scripts can be developed to use external Test Data to control the conditional 
    branching logic within the Test Script.</li>

</div>

<p>Especially in the case of test automation, you will probably need to spend 
  some time stabilizing the workings of the test when it is being executed. When 
  you have completed the basic implementation of the Test Script, it should be 
  tested to ensure it implements the individual tests appropriately and that they 
  execute properly.</p>

<h4><a name="Recover">Recover test environment to known state</a>
   <a href="#VerifyTestImplementation"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Verify Test Implementation" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 
<p>Again, you should restore the environment back to it's original state, cleaning 
  up after your test implementation work. As mentioned in previous steps, this 
  will typically involve some form of basic operating environment reset, restoration 
  of underlying databases to known state, and so forth in addition to tasks such 
  as loading paper into printers. While some tasks can be performed automatically, 
  some aspects typically require human attention.</p>

   <a href="#VerifyTestImplementation"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Verify Test Implementation" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 
<p>Especially in the case of test automation, the settings within the supporting 
  tools should be changed The objective is to verify the correct workings of the 
  Test Script by executing the Test Script.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to perform this step using the same Build version of the software 
  used to implement the Test Scripts. This eliminates the possibility of problems 
  due to introduced errors in subsequent builds.</p>

<h4><a name="ResolveExecutionErrors">Resolve execution errors</a>
   <a href="#VerifyTestImplementation"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Verify Test Implementation" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4> 
<p>It's pretty common that some of the things done and approaches used during 
  implementation will need a degree of adjustment to enable the test to run unattended, 
  especially in regard to executing the test under multiple Test Environment Configurations.</p>
<p>In the case of test automation, be prepared to spend some time checking and 
  the tests &quot;function within tolerances&quot; and adjusting them until they 
  work reliably before you declare the test as implemented. While you might delay 
  this step until later in the lifecycle (e.g. during Test Suite development), 
  we recommend that you don't: otherwise you could end up with a significant backlog 
  of failures that need to be addressed.</p>

</div>

<p>While this step might seem trivial, but it's an important good habit to form 
  to work effectively with the other testers on the team&#151;especially where 
  the implementation environment is shared. It's also important to establish a 
  routine that makes thinking of the system state second nature.</p>
<p>While in a primarily manual testing effort, it's often simple to identify and 
  fix environment restore problems, remember that test automation has much less 
  ability to tolerate unanticipated problems with environment state.</p>

     </tr>

<br>
</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is a good practice to verify that 
  the work was of sufficient value. You should evaluate whether your work is of 
  appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those team 
  members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, 
  use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are 
  &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people who will use your work as input in performing their downstream 
  activities take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still 
  have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also 
  evaluate your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  or considered them sufficiently and accurately. It may be useful to have the 
  author of the input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  in many cases counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only 
  be partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent downstream 
  work. This is because there is a high probability that the situation surrounding 
  the artifact will change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was 
  created proven incorrect&#151;before the artifact is used, resulting in rework 
  and therefore wasted effort.</p>
<p>Also avoid the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment 
  of the value of the content itself. In project environments where presentation 
  has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to 
  consider using an administrative or junior resource to perform work on an artifact 
  to improve it's presentation.</p>
