<p>A development case is developed to be used in a software-development project 
  and is consider part of the project-specific process. It is a refinement of 
  the development process configured for the project, see <a href="../artifact/ar_dvlprc.htm">Artifact: 
  Development Process</a> for further information.</p>
<p>The project's phase plan and organization has a major impact on the process, 
  and vice versa. Therefore, the development of the development case must be coordinated 
  with development of the project plan. See the <a href="../artifact/ar_sdp.htm">Artifact: 
  Software Development Plan</a>, section &quot;Project Plan&quot;, for more details. 
  For example, if the project decides to use a different set of phases than in 
  the Rational Unified Process (RUP), this is something that needs to be captured 
  in the development case.</p>
<p>The project's choice of configuration items also has a major impact on the 
  process, and vice versa. Therefore, the development of the development case 
  must be coordinated with development of the configuration management plan. The 
  configuration items are defined in the configuration management plan. See 
  <a href="../artifact/ar_cmpln.htm">Artifact: Configuration Management Plan</a> 
  and <a href="../workflow/conf_mgt/co_pdirs.htm">Concepts: Product Directory 
  Structure</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="PerformDisciplines">Decide How to Perform</a> Each Discipline <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Part of tailoring the RUP framework for use on a specific project is to decide 
  on which disciplines to introduce. As described in <a href="ac_tlrprjprc.htm">Activity: 
  Tailor the Process for the Project</a>, you should avoid using all of RUP in 
  one single project. And if your project is fairly new to the practices described 
  in the RUP, you should concentrate on limiting the number of unknown factors 
  to a handful, to ease the transition of the teams onto a new process platform. 
</p>
<p>Once you have decided which disciplines you need to introduce, decide the following 
  for each:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to perform the workflow.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Which parts of the workflow should be used.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When, during the project's lifecycle, to introduce the workflows and their 
    parts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you decide, there are is a section &quot;Decide How to Perform the 
  Workflow&quot;, in each of the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>

  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idbm.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Business Modeling</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idreq.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Requirements</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idad.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Analysis &amp; Design</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idimp.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Implementation</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idtst.htm#DecideHowToPerformTheWorkflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Test</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idep.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Deployment</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idpmgt.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Project Management</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idccm.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Configuration &amp; Change Management</a></li>


  <li><a href="../modguide/md_idenv.htm#Decide How to Perform the Workflow">Guidelines: 
    Important Decisions in Environment</a></li>

</ul>
<p>When you consider introducing a particular discipline, or part of one, take 
  the following into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Applicability</b>. Is it applicable for the project? Does it really add 
    value to introduce it?</li>
  <li><b>Problems and root causes addressed</b>. Does it address any of the perceived 
    problems and their root causes?</li>
  <li><b>Tool support</b>. What tool support is needed?</li>
  <li><b>Timing</b>. When during the project's lifecycle should it be introduced? 
    See <a href="../workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm">Concepts: Implementing a Process 
    in a Project</a>, for more information.</li>
  <li><b>Cost of implementing</b>. What is the cost of implementing it in the 
    project? This includes: 
    <ul>
      <li>Cost to train project members.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Cost to install the supporting tools.</li>
      <li>Cost to develop guidelines and templates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="TailorArtifacts">Tailor Artifacts per Discipline </a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Select the right set of artifacts for the project to produce. Just because 
  an artifact is part of the configured process, doesn't mean that the project 
  has to produce it. The configuration is often defined over a selection of process 
  components, not at the level of individual artifacts. Typically, your development 
  case should define a subset of the artifacts you'll find in the process Website.
<p>If you cannot clearly articulate why the artifact should be produced, for example 
  if no external stakeholder has requested it, then consider to exlude it. It 
  is a good practice to use the development case to document any deviations from 
  the underlying process, so exclusion of any artifact should be justified and 
  documented.
<p>Tailor the artifacts for each of the disciplines. See <a href="../modguide/md_tailr.htm">Guidelines: 
  Process Tailoring Practices</a>. 
<p>Don't do all of the disciplines at once–focus on the next one to be applied 
  in the project. Perform the following steps: 
<ol>
  <li>Decide how the artifact (modeling element or document) should be used (see 
    <a href="../modguide/md_uclaar.htm">Guidelines: Classifying Artifacts</a> 
    for more information): 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Must have</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Should have</b></li>
      <li><b>Could have</b></li>
      <li><b>Won't have</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Decide the review level for each artifact and capture it in the &quot;Review 
    Details&quot;. For details see <a href="../modguide/md_review.htm">Guidelines: 
    Review Levels</a>. Decide how to review each artifact; that is, which review 
    procedures to use.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Decide how you should capture the final results of a discipline. Do you 
    need to store the results on paper? If so, you have to decide on one or several 
    reports that extract the results from the tools, and capture the results on 
    paper.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Decide which tools to use to develop and maintain the artifact.</li>
  <li>Decide which properties to use and how to use them. See the Properties table 
    for each artifact and the section titled &quot;Tailoring&quot; of each artifact.</li>
  <li>When relevant, decide which stereotypes to use. For each artifact, see the 
    section titled &quot;Tailoring.&quot;</li>
  <li>Decide on an outline for the document artifacts. For the respective artifact, 
    see the section titled &quot;Brief Outline.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these steps you should also: 
<ul>
  <li>Decide which reports to use. Decide if you need any work reports to extract 
    information from models, then document the information on paper for reviews. 
    These work reports are usually treated as casual since they are temporary 
    and will be discarded as soon as the review is complete. You may need to tailor 
    the outline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more things to decide for each discipline. See the guidelines for 
  each discipline for more details: 
<h3><a name="ModifyDisciplines">Modify Disciplines and Activities</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Study the modified set of artifacts and the activities that use, create and 
  update these artifacts. Decide whether you should modify or simplify these activities. 
  Note that for each activity input and output artifacts are indicated. Be sure 
  to delete any unnecessary step or activity. Consider the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Introduce new steps and possibly new activities to reflects the artifacts, 
    reports, and documents that you have had to add.</li>
  <li>Examine how the tools used can facilitate, automate, or even suppress some 
    of the steps.</li>
  <li>Introduce into the activities any specific guidelines and rules inherited 
    from the organization's experience. They may be added as guidance points, 
    checkpoints, review items, or left as separate documents that can be referenced.</li>
  <li>Once the activities are known, revisit the workflows that show how activities 
    interplay, removing or adding activities as necessary.</li>
  <li>Whole disciplines can be omitted or created.</li>
  <li>You may have to introduce some additional roles to take care of special 
    activities requiring specific skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe the changes in the Development Case.</p>


<h3><a name="ChooseLifecycleModel">Choose Lifecycle Model</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Choose the kind of lifecycle model the project should employ. Refine the RUP 
  model and adjust milestones and the milestone evaluation criteria if necessary. 
  You may even decide to omit one or several of the phases, or add or remove milestones. 
  See <a href="../itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">Phases</a> and <a href="../workflow/manageme/co_phase.htm">Concepts: 
  Iteration</a> for more information and ideas. Document the project's lifecycle 
  model in the section &quot;Overview of the Development Case&quot;.</p>


<h3><a name="DescribeIterationWorkflows">Describe Sample Iterations</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Describe at least one sample iteration (more likely you will describe several) 
  for each phase. These iteration descriptions describe how the project will work 
  in different iterations and phases of the project. The RUP suggests two different 
  ways of defining sample iterations. One approach is to define cross-discipline 
  example iteration workflows, see <a href="../../manuals/intro/kc_it_workflow.htm">Key 
  Concept: Iteration Workflow</a> for a definition, or see the different phase 
  descriptions under the <a href="../itrwkfls/iwf_iwfs.htm">RUP Lifecycle</a> 
  page for detailed examples. The other approach is to define a set of sample 
  iteration plans. </p>
<p>The purpose of describing sample iterations in the development case is to communicate 
  to the project teams, which activities your project will perform, and in which 
  order. As such it can serve as a more detailed iteration plan. The description 
  of the sample iterations should be brief. Do not include details that belong 
  in the activities, artifacts and guidelines. You can choose to describe the 
  sample iterations in terms of activities or workflow details. Workflow detail 
  based descriptions can be easier to use for planning and control at the management 
  level, but activity based descriptions are preferred when using them at the 
  practitioner level.</p>
<p>In most cases you should describe at least one sample iteration per phase. 
  Describe the sample iterations as they are needed; there is no reason to describe 
  how to work during the Transition phase at the beginning of a project. Start 
  by defining how the project will work in the Inception phase.</p>
<h3><a name="IdentifyStakeholders">Identify Stakeholders</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The role <a href="../workers/wk_sthld.htm">Stakeholder</a> represents all possible 
  stakeholders to a project. You need to identify and describe the different types 
  of stakeholders, their needs and responsibilities. Examples of different stakeholders 
  are customer representative, user representative, investor, production manager, 
  and buyer.</p>
<p>Describe the different stakeholders and their needs in the development case, 
  in the section &quot;Roles&quot;.</p>


<h3><a name="MapWorkersToJobPositions">Map Roles to Job Positions</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In some development organizations there are job positions defined. If these 
  job positions are commonly used and have a wide acceptance within the organization, 
  it may be worth doing a mapping between the roles in the RUP, and the job positions 
  in the organization. Mapping job positions to roles can make it easier to make 
  people in the organization understand how to employ the RUP. The mapping can 
  also help people understand that roles are not job positions, which is a common 
  misconception. Document this mapping in the development case, section &quot;Roles&quot;.</p>


<h3><a name="DocumentDevelopmentCase">Document the Development Case</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Describe the development case. We recommend that you describe the development 
  case on one or several web pages, with hyperlinks to the RUP online, and to 
  other guidelines. This is explained in the section &quot;Representing a Development 
  Case Online&quot; in <a href="../modguide/md_dvcas.htm">Guideline: Development 
  Case</a>. Use the <a href="../../examples/ex_dvlcs.htm">Example: Development 
  Case</a> as a starting point.</p>


<h3><a name="MaintainDevelopmentCase">Maintain the Development Case</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Many of the decisions should be made before the project starts. After each 
  iteration in the software-development project you should evaluate the process, 
  and reconsider the decisions you have made. If a new version of the underlying 
  configuration is released, you need to update the development case. </p>
