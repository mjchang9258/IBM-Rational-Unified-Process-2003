<p>Classes are the work-horses of the design effort&#151they actually perform 
  the real work of the system. Other design elements, such as subsystems, packages, 
  and collaborations, describe how classes are grouped or how they interoperate.</p>

<p class="reactive">Capsules are also stereotyped classes, used to represent concurrent 
  threads of execution in real-time systems. In such cases, other design classes 
  are passive classes, used within the execution context provided by the active 
  capsules. When the software architect and designer choose not to use a design 
  approach based on capsules, it's still possible to model concurrent behavior 
  using active classes.</p>

<p>Active classes are design classes that coordinate and drive the behavior of 
  the passive classes&#151an active class is a class whose instances are active 
  objects, owning their own thread of control.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_patterns__using"></a><a name="XE_mechanisms__using"></a><a name="Use Design Patterns and Mechanisms">Use 
  Design Patterns and Mechanisms</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Use design patterns and mechanisms as suited to the class or capability being 
  designed, and in accordance with project design guidelines.</p>
<p>Incorporating a pattern and/or mechanism is effectively performing many of 
  the subsequent steps in this activity (adding new classes, operations, attributes, 
  and relationships), but in accordance with the rules defined by the pattern 
  or mechanism.</p>
<p>Note that patterns and mechanisms are typically incorporated as the design 
  evolves, and not just as the first step in this activity. They are also frequently 
  applied across a set of classes, rather than only to a single class.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_class__creating_design_classes_initially"></a><a name="Create Initial Design Classes"></a>Create
Initial Design Classes <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Create one or several initial design classes for the analysis class given as 
  input to this activity and assign trace dependencies. The design classes created 
  in this step will be refined, adjusted, split, or merged in subsequent steps 
  when assigned various design properties&#151such as operations, methods, and a 
  state machine&#151that describe how the analysis class is designed.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of the analysis class (boundary, entity, or control) 
  being designed, there are specific strategies you can use to create initial 
  design classes.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_boundary_class__designing"></a><a name="Designing boundary classes">Designing 
  boundary classes</a></h4>
<p>Boundary classes either represent interfaces to users or to other systems.</p>
<p>Typically, boundary classes that represent interfaces to other systems are 
  modeled as subsystems, because they often have complex internal behavior. If 
  the interface behavior is simple (perhaps acting as only a pass-through to an 
  existing API to the external system), you might choose to represent the interface 
  with one or more design classes. If you choose this route, use a single design 
  class per protocol, interface, or API and note special requirements about standards 
  you used in the special requirements of the class.</p>
<p>Boundary classes that represent interfaces to users generally follow the rule 
  of one boundary class for each window, or one for each form, in the user interface. 
  Consequently the responsibilities of the boundary classes can be on a fairly 
  high-level, and need to be refined and detailed in this step. Additional models 
  or prototypes of the user interface can be another source of input to be considered 
  in this step.</p>
<p>The design of boundary classes depends on the user interface (UI) development 
  tools available to the project. Using current technology, it's common that the 
  UI is visually constructed directly in the development tool. This automatically 
  creates UI classes that need to be related to the design of control and entity 
  classes. If the UI development environment automatically creates the supporting 
  classes it needs to implement the UI, there is no need to consider them in design. 
  You design only what the development environment does not create for you.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_entity_class__designing"></a><a name="Designing Entity Classes">Designing 
  entity classes</a></h4>
<p>During analysis, entity classes represent manipulated units of information. 
  They are often passive and persistent, and might be identified and associated 
  with the analysis mechanism for persistence.  
  The details of designing a database-based persistence mechanism are covered 
  in <a href="ac_dbdes.htm">Activity: Database Design</a>. Performance considerations 
  could force some refactoring of persistent classes, causing changes to the Design 
  Model that are discussed jointly between the <a href="../workers/wk_dbdsr.htm">Role: 
  Database Designer</a> and the <a href="../workers/wk_dsgnr.htm">Role: Designer</a>. 
  </p>
<p>A broader discussion of design issues for persistent classes is presented later 
  under the heading <a href="#Define Persistent Classes">Identify Persistent Classes</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_control_class__designing"></a><a name="Designing Control Classes">Designing 
  control classes</a></h4>
<p>A control object is responsible for managing the flow of a use case and, therefore, 
  coordinates most of its actions; control objects encapsulate logic that is not 
  particularly related to user interface issues (boundary objects) or to data 
  engineering issues (entity objects). This logic is sometimes called <b>application 
  logic</b> or <b>business logic</b>.</p>
<p>Take the following issues into consideration when control classes are designed:</p> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Complexity</b> &#151 You can handle uncomplicated controlling 
    or coordinating behavior using boundary or entity classes. As the complexity 
    of the application grows, however, significant drawbacks to this approach 
    surface, such as:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>the use-case coordinating behavior becomes imbedded in the UI, making 
      it more difficult to change the system</li>
    <li>the same UI cannot be used in different use-case realizations without 
      difficulty</li>
    <li>the UI becomes burdened with additional functionality, degrading its performance</li>
    <li>the entity objects might become burdened with use-case specific behavior, 
      reducing their generality</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid these problems, control classes are introduced to provide behavior 
    related to coordinating flows-of-events.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Change probability</b> &#151 If the probability of changing 
    flows of events is low or the cost is negligible, the extra expense and complexity 
    of additional control classes might not be justified.</li>
  <li><b>Distribution and performance</b> &#151 The need to run parts 
    of the application on different nodes, or in different process spaces, introduces 
    the need to specialize design model elements. This specialization is often 
    accomplished by adding control objects and distributing behavior from the 
    boundary and entity classes onto the control classes. In doing this, the boundary 
    classes migrate toward providing purely UI services, the entity classes move 
    toward providing purely data services, and the control classes provide the 
    rest.</li>
  <li><b>Transaction management</b> &#151 Managing transactions is a 
    classic coordination activity. Without a framework to handle transaction management, 
    one or more <b>transaction manager</b> classes would have to interact 
    to ensure that you maintain the integrity of the transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter two cases, if the control class represents a separate thread 
  of control, it may be more appropriate to use an active class to model the thread 
  of control.</p>

<h3><a name="XE_persistent_class__identifying"></a><a name="XE_entity_class__define_persistent_classes"></a><a name="Define Persistent Classes">Identify 
  Persistent Classes</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Classes that need to store their state on a permanent medium are referred to 
  as persistent. The need to store their state might be for permanent recording 
  of class information, for back-up in case of system failure, or for exchange 
  of information. A persistent class might have both persistent and transient 
  instances; labeling a class persistent means merely that some instances of the 
  class might need to be persistent.</p>
<p>Incorporate design mechanisms corresponding to persistency mechanisms found 
  during analysis. For example, depending on what is required by the class, the 
  analysis mechanism for persistency might be realized by one of these design 
  mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In-memory storage</li>
  <li>Flash card</li>
  <li>Binary file</li>
  <li>Database Management System (DBMS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Persistent objects might not be derived from entity classes only; persistent 
  objects could also be needed to handle nonfunctional requirements in general. 
  Examples are persistent objects needed to maintain information relevant to process 
  control or to maintain state information between transactions.</p>


<p>Identifying persistent classes serves to notify the <a href="../workers/wk_dbdsr.htm">Role: 
  Database Designer</a> that the class requires special attention to its physical 
  storage characteristics. It also notifies the <a href="../workers/wk_archt.htm">Role: 
  Software Architect</a> that the class needs to be persistent and the <a href="../workers/wk_dsgnr.htm">Role: 
  Designer</a> responsible for the persistence mechanism that instances of the 
  class need to be made persistent.</p>
<p>Due to the need for a coordinated persistence strategy, the <a href="../workers/wk_dbdsr.htm">Role: 
  Database Designer</a> is responsible for mapping persistent classes into the 
  database, using a persistence framework. If the project is developing a persistence 
  framework, the framework developer will also be responsible for understanding 
  the persistence requirements of design classes. To provide these people with 
  the information they need, it's sufficient at this point to indicate that the 
  class is persistent or, more precisely, that the instances of the class are 
  persistent.</p>

<p>For each class, determine the class visibility within the package in which 
  it resides. A <i>public</i> class can be referenced outside of the containing 
  package. A <i>private</i> class (or one whose visibility is <i>implementation</i>) 
  might only be referenced by classes within the same package.</p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="Identifying operations">Identifying operations</a></h4>
<p>To identify operations on design classes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Study the responsibilities of each corresponding analysis class, creating 
    an operation for each responsibility. Use the description of the responsibility 
    as the initial description of the operation.</li>
  <li>Study the use-case realizations in the class <i>participates</i> to see 
    how the operations are used by the use-case realizations. Extend the operations, 
    one use-case realization at the time, refining the operations, their descriptions, 
    return types, and parameters. Each use-case realization's requirements pertaining 
    to classes are described textually in the Flow of Events of the use-case realization.</li>
  <li>Study the Special Requirements use case to be sure that you do not miss 
    implicit requirements on the operation that might be stated there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Operations are required to support the messages that appear on sequence diagrams 
  because scripts&#151temporary message specifications that have not yet been 
  assigned to operations&#151describe the behavior the class is expected to perform. 
  Figure 1 illustrates an example of a sequence diagram.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/seqdiag1.gif" width="672" height="417"></p>
<p class="caption" align="center"><b>Figure 1: Messages Form the Basis for Identifying 
  Operations</b></p>
<p>Use-case realizations cannot provide enough information to identify all
operations. To find the remaining operations, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there a way to initialize a new instance of the class, including
    connecting it to instances of other classes to which it is associated?</li>
  <li>Is there a need to test to see if two instances of the class are equal?</li>
  <li>Is there a need to create a copy of a class instance?</li>
  <li>Are any operations required on the class by mechanisms that they use? For 
    example, a <i>garbage collection</i> mechanism might require that an object 
    is able to drop all of its references to all other objects so that any unused 
    resources can be freed up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not define operations that merely get and set the values of public attributes 
  (see <a href="#Define Attributes">Define Attributes</a> and <a href="#Define Associations">Define 
  Associations</a>). Usually these are generated by code-generation facilities 
  and do not need to be defined explicitly.</p>
<h4><a name="XE_operation__naming"></a><a name="Naming and describing the operations">Naming
and describing the operations</a></h4>
<p>Use naming conventions for the implementation language when you're naming operations, 
  return types, and parameters and their types.  These 
  are described in the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project 
  Specific Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>For each operation, you should define the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The operation name</b> &#151 keep the name short and descriptive 
    of the result the operation achieves. 
    <ul>
      <li>The names of operations should follow the syntax of the implementation
        language. Example: <b>find_location</b> would be acceptable
        for C++ or Visual Basic, but not for Smalltalk (in which underscores are
        not used); a better name for all would be <b>findLocation</b>.</li>
      <li>Avoid names that imply how the operation is performed. For example, 
        <b>Employee.wages()</b> is better than <b>Employee.calculateWages()</b>, 
        since the latter implies a calculation is performed. The operation may 
        simply return a value in a database.</li>
      <li>The name of an operation should clearly show its purpose. Avoid unspecific 
        names, such as <b>getData</b>, that are not descriptive about 
        the result they return. Use a name that shows exactly what is expected, 
        such as <b>getAddress</b>. Better yet, simply let the operation 
        name be the name of the property that is returned or set. If it has a 
        parameter, it sets the property. If it has no parameter, it gets the property. 
        Example: the operation <b>address </b>returns the address of 
        a <b>Customer</b>, whereas <b>address(aString)</b> 
        sets or changes the address of the <b>Customer</b>. The <i>get</i> 
        and <i>set</i> nature of the operation are implicit from the signature 
        of the operation.</li>
      <li>Operations that are conceptually the same should have the same name 
        even if different classes define them, if they are implemented in entirely 
        different ways, or if they have a different number of parameters. An operation 
        that creates an object, for example, should have the same name in all 
        classes.</li>
      <li>If operations in several classes have the same signature, the operation 
        must return the same kind of result appropriate for the receiver object. 
        This is an example of the concept of <b>polymorphism</b>, which 
        says that different objects should respond to the same message in similar 
        ways. Example: the operation <b>name</b> should return the name 
        of the object, regardless of how the name is stored or derived. Following 
        this principle makes the model easier to understand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The return type</b> &#151 The return type should be the class of
    object that is returned by the operation.</li>
  <li><b>A short description</b> &#151 As meaningful as you try to make 
    it, the name of the operation is often only vaguely useful when trying to 
    understand what the operation does. Give the operation a short description 
    consisting of a couple of sentences, written from the operation <b>user's</b> 
    perspective.</li>
  <li><b>The parameters</b> &#151 For each parameter, create a short 
    descriptive name, decide on its class, and give it a brief description. As 
    you specify parameters, remember that fewer parameters mean better reusability. 
    A small number of parameters makes the operation easier to understand and, 
    therefore, there is a higher likelihood of finding similar operations. You 
    may need to divide an operation with many parameters into several operations. 
    The operation must be understandable to those who want to use it. The brief 
    description should include: 
    <ul>
      <li>the meaning of the parameters, if not apparent from their names</li>
      <li>whether the parameter is passed <b>by value</b> or <b>by 
        reference</b></li>
      <li>parameters that must have values supplied</li>
      <li>parameters that can be optional and their default values, if no value 
        is provided</li>
      <li>valid ranges for parameters, if applicable</li>
      <li>what is done in the operation</li>
      <li>what <b>by reference </b>parameters are changed by the operation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Once you've defined the operations, complete the sequence diagrams 
  with information about what operations are invoked for each message.</p>
<p align="left">Refer to the section titled <a href="../modguide/md_class.htm#Class Operations"><i>Class 
  Operations</i> in Guidelines: Design Class</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Defining operation visibility">Defining operation 
  visibility</a></h4>
<p align="left">For each operation, identify the export visibility of the operation 
  from these choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Public</b> &#151 the operation is visible to model elements 
    other than the class itself.</li>
  <li><b>Implementation</b> &#151 the operation is visible only within 
    the class itself.</li>
  <li><b>Protected</b> &#151 the operation is visible only to the class 
    itself, to its subclasses, or to <i>friends</i> of the class (language-dependent).</li>
  <li><b>Private</b> &#151 the operation is visible only to the class 
    itself and to <i>friends</i> of the class</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the most restricted visibility possible that can still accomplish the 
  objectives of the operation. To do this, look at the sequence diagrams and, 
  for each message, determine whether the message is coming from a class outside 
  of the receiver's package (requires <b>public</b> visibility), from 
  inside of the package (requires <b>implementation</b> visibility), 
  from a subclass (requires <b>protected </b>visibility), or from the 
  class itself or a friend (requires <b>private</b> visibility).</p>
<h4><a name="Defining class operations">Defining class operations</a></h4>
<p>For the most part, operations are instance operations; that is, they are performed 
  on instances of the class. In some cases, however, an operation applies to all 
  instances of the class and, therefore, is a <b>class-scope</b> operation. The 
  class operation receiver is actually an instance of a <b>metaclass</b>&#151the 
  description of the class itself&#151rather than any specific instance of the 
  class. Examples of class operations include messages that create (instantiate) 
  new instances, which return <b>allInstances</b> of a class, and so 
  on.</p>
<p>The operation string is underlined to denote a class-scope operation.</p>

  the behavior required by the operation is sufficiently defined by the operation 
  name, description, and parameters, methods are implemented directly in the programming 
  language. Where the implementation of an operation requires the use of a specific 
  algorithm or more information than is presented in the operation's description, 
  a separate <b>method</b> description is required. The <b>method</b> 
  describes how the operation works, not just what it does.</p>
<p>If described, the method should discuss how: </p>
<ul>
  <li> operations will be implemented</li>
  <li> attributes will be implemented and used to implement operations</li>
  <li> relationships will be implemented and used to implement operations</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements will vary from case to case, however, the method specifications 
  for a class should always state: </p>
<ul>
  <li>what will be done according to the requirements</li>
  <li>what other objects and their operations will be used</li>
</ul>
<p>More specific requirements might concern: </p>
<ul>
  <li>how parameters will be implemented</li>
  <li>what, if any, special algorithms will be used</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequence diagrams are an important source for this. From these it's clear what 
  operations will be used in other objects when an operation is performed. A specification 
  of what operations will be used in other objects is necessary for the full implementation 
  of an operation. The production of a complete method specification, therefore, 
  requires that you identify the operations for the objects involved and inspect 
  the corresponding sequence diagrams.</p>

<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>For some operations, the behavior of the operation depends upon the state the 
  receiver object is in. A state machine is a tool that describes the states an 
  object can assume and the events that cause the object to move from one state 
  to another (see <a href="../modguide/md_stadm.htm">Guidelines: Statechart Diagram)</a>. 
  State machines are most useful for describing active classes.</p>

<p class="reactive">Using state machines is particularly important for defining 
  the behavior of <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_cpsl.htm">Artifact: 
  Capsule</a>s.</p>

<p>An example of a simple state machine is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/statedg.gif" width="439" height="363"></p>
<p class="picturetext"><b>Figure 2:  A Simple Statechart Diagram for a Fuel Dispenser</b></p>
<p>Each state transition event can be associated with an operation. Depending 
  on the object's state, the operation may have a different behavior and the transition 
  events describe how this occurs.</p>
<p>The <b>method</b> description for the associated operation should 
  be updated with the state-specific information, indicating for each relevant 
  state what the operation should do. States are often represented using <b>attributes</b>; 
  the statechart diagrams serve as input into the attribute identification step.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_stadm.htm">Guidelines:
Statechart Diagram</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_attribute_on_object__defining_on_classes"></a><a name="Define Attributes">Define
Attributes</a><a name="Define Attributes"></a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>During the definition of <b>methods</b> and the identification of 
  <b>states</b>, attributes needed by the class to carry out its operations 
  are identified. Attributes provide information storage for the class instance 
  and are often used to represent the state of the class instance. Any information 
  the class itself maintains is done through its <b>attributes</b>. 
  For each attribute, define: </p>
<ul>
  <li>its <b>name</b>, which should follow the naming conventions of 
    both the implementation language and the project</li>
  <li>its <b>type</b>, which will be an elementary data type supported 
    by the implementation language</li>
  <li>its <b>default or initial value</b>, to which it is initialized
    when new instances of the class are created</li>
  <li>its <b>visibility</b>, which will take one of the following
    values:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Public</b>: the attribute is visible both inside and outside 
        of the package containing the class</li>
      <li><b>Protected</b>: the attribute is visible only to the class 
        itself, to its subclasses, or to friends of the class 
        (language-dependent)</li>
      <li><b>Private</b>: the attribute is only visible to the class 
        itself and to friends of the class</li>
      <li><b>Implementation</b>: the attribute is visible only to the 
        class itself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for <b>persistent classes</b>, whether the attribute is persistent (the 
    default) or transient&#151even though the class itself may be persistent, 
    not all attributes of the class need to be persistent</li>
</ul>
<p>Check to make sure all attributes are needed. Attributes should be justified&#151it's 
  easy for attributes to be added early in the process and survive long after 
  they're no longer needed due to shortsightedness. Extra attributes, multiplied 
  by thousands or millions of instances, can have a detrimental effect on the 
  performance and storage requirements of a system.</p>
<p>Refer to the section titled <i>Attributes</i> in <a href="../modguide/md_class.htm">Guidelines: 
  Design Class</a> for more information on attributes.</p>
<h3><a name="Define Dependencies">Define Dependencies</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>For each case where the communication between objects is required, ask these 
  questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the reference to the receiver passed as a parameter to the operation? 
    If so, establish a <b>dependency </b>between the sender and receiver 
    classes in a class diagram containing the two classes. Also, if the <b>collaboration 
    diagram</b> format for interactions is used, then qualify the link visibility 
    and set it to <b>parameter</b>.</li>
  <li>Is the receiver a global? If so, establish a <b>dependency </b>between 
    the sender and receiver classes in a class diagram containing the two classes. 
    Also, if the <b>collaboration diagram</b> format for interactions 
    is used, qualify the link visibility and set it to <b>global</b>.</li>
  <li>Is the receiver a temporary object created and destroyed during the operation 
    itself? If so, establish a <b>dependency </b>between the sender 
    and receiver classes in a class diagram containing the two classes. Also, 
    if the <b>collaboration diagram</b> format for interactions is used, 
    qualify the link visibility and set it to <b>local</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that links modeled this way are transient links, existing only for a limited 
  duration in the specific context of the collaboration&#151in that sense, they 
  are instances of the association role in the collaboration. However, the relationship 
  in a class model (that is, independent of context) should be a dependency, as 
  previously stated. As [<a href="../referenc.htm#RUM98">RUM98</a>] states, in 
  the definition of <b>transient link</b>: &quot;It is possible to model all such 
  links as associations, but then the conditions on the associations must be stated 
  very broadly, and they lose much of their precision in constraining combinations 
  of objects.&quot; In this situation, the modeling of a dependency is less important 
  than the modeling of the relationship in the collaboration, because the dependency 
  does not describe the relationship completely; only that it exists.</p>
<h3><a name="Define Associations">Define Associations</a><a name="Define Attributes and Relationships"></a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Associations provide the mechanism for objects to communicate with one another. 
  They provide objects with a conduit along which messages can flow. They also 
  document the dependencies between classes, highlighting that changes in one 
  class could be felt among many other classes.</p>
<p>Examine the <b>method</b> descriptions for each operation to understand 
  how instances of the class communicate and collaborate with other objects. To 
  send a message to another object, an object must have a reference to the receiver 
  of the message. A collaboration diagram (an alternative representation of a 
  sequence diagram) will show object communication in terms of links, as illustrated 
  in Figure 3.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/collabd.gif" width="610" height="493"></p>
<p class="picturetext"><b>Figure 3: An Example of a Collaboration Diagram</b></p>
<h4><a name="Defining associations and aggregations">Defining associations and aggregations</a></h4>
<p>The remaining messages use either <b>association</b> or <b>aggregation</b> 
  to specify the relationship between instances of two classes that communicate. 
  See <a href="../modguide/md_assoc.htm">Guidelines: Association</a> and <a href="../modguide/md_aggrg.htm">Guidelines: 
  Aggregation</a> for information on choosing the appropriate representation. 
  For both of these associations, set the link visibility to <b>field</b> 
  in collaboration diagrams. Other tasks include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish the navigability of associations and aggregations. You can do 
    this by considering what navigabilities are required on their link instantiations 
    in the interaction diagrams. Because navigability is <b>true</b> 
    by default, you only need to find associations (and aggregations) where all 
    opposite link roles of all objects of a class in the association do not require 
    navigability. In those cases, set the navigability to <b>false</b> 
    on the role of the class.</li>
  <li>If there are attributes on the association itself (represented by association 
    classes), create a design class to represent the association class, with the 
    appropriate attributes. Interpose this class between the other two classes, 
    and establish associations with appropriate multiplicity between the association 
    class and the other two classes.</li>
  <li>Specify whether <i>association ends</i> should be <b>ordered</b> 
    or not; this is the case when the objects associated with an object at the 
    other end of the association have an ordering that must be preserved.</li>
  <li>If the associated (or aggregated) class is only referenced by the current 
    class, consider whether the class should be nested. Advantages of nesting 
    classes include faster messaging and a simpler design model. Disadvantages 
    include having the space for the nested class statically allocated regardless 
    of whether there are instances of the nested class, a lack of object identity 
    separate from the enclosing class, or an inability to reference nested class 
    instances from outside of the enclosing class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Associations and aggregations are best defined in a class diagram that depicts 
  the associated classes. The class diagram should be <b>owned</b> by 
  the package that contains the associated classes. Figure 4 illustrates an example 
  of a class diagram, depicting associations and aggregations.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/classdg.gif" width="469" height="396"></p>

<h4><a name="Handling Subscribe-Associations between Analysis Classes">Handling 
  subscribe-associations between analysis classes</a></h4>
<p>Subscribe-associations between <b>analysis classes </b>are used to 
  identify event dependencies between classes. In the Design Model you must handle 
  these event dependencies explicitly, either by using available event-handler 
  frameworks or by designing and building your own event-handler framework. In 
  some programming languages&#151such as Visual Basic&#151this is straightforward; 
  you declare, raise, and handle the corresponding events. In other languages, 
  you might have to use some additional library of reusable functions to handle 
  subscriptions and events. If the functionality can't be purchased, it will need 
  to be designed and built. See also <a href="../modguide/md_sbscr.htm">Guidelines: 
  Subscribe-Association</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Define Generalizations">Define Generalizations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Classes might be organized into a generalization hierarchy to reflect common 
  behavior and common structure. A common <b>superclass</b> can be defined, 
  from which <b>subclasses </b>can inherit both behavior and structure. 
  Generalization is a notational convenience that allows you to define common 
  structure and behavior in one place, and to reuse it where you find repeated 
  behavior and structure. Refer to <a href="../modguide/md_gener.htm">Guidelines: 
  Generalization</a> for more information on generalization relationships.</p>
<p>When you find a generalization, create a common superclass to contain the common 
  attributes, associations, aggregations, and operations. Remove the common behavior 
  from the classes that will become subclasses of the common superclass. Define 
  a <b>generalization relationship</b> from the subclass to the superclass.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_concurrency_conflicts__identifying"></a><a name="Resolve Use-Case Collisions">Resolve
Use-Case Collisions</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>The purpose of this step is to prevent concurrency conflicts caused when two 
  or more use cases could potentially access instances of the design class simultaneously, 
  in possibly inconsistent ways.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties with proceeding use-case-by-use-case through the design 
  process is that two or more use cases could attempt to invoke operations simultaneously 
  on design objects in potentially conflicting ways. In these cases, concurrency 
  conflicts must be identified and resolved explicitly.</p>
<p>If synchronous messaging is used, executing an operation will block subsequent 
  calls to the objects until the operation completes. Synchronous messaging implies 
  a first-come, first-served ordering to message processing. This might resolve 
  the concurrency conflict, especially in cases where all messages have the same 
  priority or where every message runs within the same execution thread. In cases 
  where an object might be accessed by different threads of execution (represented 
  by active classes), explicit mechanisms must be used to prevent or resolve the 
  concurrency conflict.</p>

<p class="reactive"> In real-time systems where threads are represented by <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_cpsl.htm">Artifact: 
  Capsule</a>s, this problem still has to be solved for multiple concurrent access 
  to passive objects, whereas the capsules themselves provide a queuing mechanism 
  and enforce run-to-completion semantics to handle concurrent access. A recommended 
  solution is to encapsulate passive objects within capsules, which avoids the 
  problem of concurrent access through the semantics of the capsule itself.</p>

<p>It might be possible for different operations on the same object to be invoked 
  simultaneously by different threads of execution without a concurrency conflict; 
  both the name and address of a customer could be modified concurrently without 
  conflict. It's only when two different threads of execution attempt to modify 
  the same property of the object that a conflict occurs.</p>
<p>For each object that might be accessed concurrently by different threads of 
  execution, identify the code sections that must be protected from simultaneous 
  access. Early in the Elaboration phase, identification of specific code segments 
  will be impossible; operations that must be protected will suffice. Next, select 
  or design appropriate access control mechanisms to prevent conflicting simultaneous 
  access. Examples of these mechanisms include message queuing to serialize access, 
  use of semaphores or tokens to allow access only to one thread at a time, or 
  other variants of locking mechanisms. The choice of mechanism tends to be highly 
  implementation-dependent, and typically varies with the programming language 
  and operating environment. 
  See the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project-Specific Guidelines</a> 
  for guidance on selecting concurrency mechanisms.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_nonfunctional_requirements__handling_of"></a><a name="Handle Non-Functional Requirements">Handle 
  Non-Functional Requirements</a> in General <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Design Classes are refined to handle general, nonfunctional requirements  
  as stated in the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project-Specific Guidelines</a>. 
  Important input to this step include the nonfunctional requirements on an analysis 
  class that may already be stated in its special requirements and responsibilities. 
  Such requirements are often specified in terms of what architectural (analysis) 
  mechanisms are needed to realize the class; in this step, the class is then 
  refined to incorporate the design mechanisms corresponding to these analysis 
  mechanisms.</p>
<p>The available design mechanisms are identified and characterized by the software 
  architect in 
  the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Project Specific Guidelines</a>. 
  For each design mechanism needed, qualify as many characteristics as possible, giving ranges 
  where appropriate. Refer to <a href="ac_dsmec.htm">Activity: Identify Design Mechanisms</a>, 
  <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_amech.htm">Concepts: Analysis Mechanisms</a>, and 
  <a href="../workflow/ana_desi/co_dmech.htm">Concepts: Design and Implementation Mechanisms</a> 
  for more information on design mechanisms.</p>
<p>There can be several general design guidelines and mechanisms that need to 
  be taken into consideration when classes are designed, such as how to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>use existing products and components</li>
  <li>adapt to the programming language</li>
  <li>distribute objects</li>
  <li>achieve acceptable performance</li>
  <li>achieve certain security levels</li>
  <li>handle errors</li>
  <li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Evaluate Your Results"></a>Evaluate Your Results <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Check the design model at this stage to verify that your work is headed in 
  the right direction. There is no need to review the model in detail, but you 
  should consider the following checkpoints: </p>
