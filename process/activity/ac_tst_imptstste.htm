<p>Begin by considering the Test Environment Configuration and specific system 
  start state. Consider what specific setup requirements there will be, such as 
  the starting data set for dependent databases. Where one Target Environment 
  Configuration will be used for various Test Suites, identify any configuration 
  settings that may need to be managed for each Test Suite, such as the screen 
  resolution of video displays or the regional operating system settings.</p>
<p>Now determine any specific relationships between the Tests. Look for dependencies 
  where the execution of one Test included in the Test Suite will result 
  in a system state change required as a precondition of another Test.</p>
<p>Once you've identified the relevant dependencies, determine the correct sequence 
  of execution for the dependent Tests.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>One of the main challenges in maintaining a Test Suite&#151;especially an automated 
  one&#151;is ensuring that ongoing changes are easy to make. It's a good idea 
  when possible and deemed useful to maintain a central point of modification 
  for elements that are used in multiple places. That's especially true if those 
  same elements are likely to change.</p>
<p>While the Tests themselves form natural units of modularity, assembly of the 
  Tests into a Test Suite often identifies duplicate procedural elements across 
  multiple Tests that could be more effectively maintained if the were consolidated. 
  Take the opportunity to identify any general mechanics of the Tests that might 
  potentially be refactored into a standard routine to assist ongoing maintenance.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>Most test efforts require the use of one or more &quot;utilities&quot; that 
  generate, gather, diagnose, convert and compare information used during test 
  execution. These utilities typically simplify both complex and laborious tasks 
  that would be prone to error if performed manually. This step relates to applying 
  existing utility functions within the Test Suite, and identifying new utilities 
  that are required.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to simplify the interfaces to these utilities, encapsulating 
  as much complexity as possible within the private implementation of the utility. 
  It's also a good idea to develop the utility in such a way that it can be reused 
  where required for both manual and automated test efforts.</p>
<p>We recommend you don't hide the information that characterizes an individual 
  test within these utilities: instead, limit the utility to the complex mechanics 
  of gathering information, or comparing actual values to expected results etc. 
  but where possible, pass the specific characteristics of each individual test 
  in as input from&#151;and return the individual actual results an output to&#151;a 
  controlling Test or Test Suite.</p>


<h3><a name="DetermineRecovery">Determine recovery requirements</a>

<table border="1" width="92%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" style="border: 1px solid rgb(128,128,128)" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#808080">
  <tbody valign="middle">
    <tr>
      <td width="5%"><b>Purpose:&nbsp;</b></td>
      <td width="95%">To enable Test Suites to be recovered without requiring the complete re-execution of the Test Suite.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Determine the appropriate points within the Test Suite to provide recovery 
  if the Test Suite fails during execution. This step gains importance where the 
  Test Suite will contain a large number of Tests, or will run for an extended 
  period of time&#151;often unattended. While most often identified as a requirement 
  for automated Test Suites, it is also important to consider recovery points 
  for manually executed Test Suites.</p>
<p>In addition to recovery or restart points you may also want&#151;in the case 
  of automated Test Suites&#151;to consider automated Test Suite recovery. Two 
  approaches to auto-recovery are 1) basic recovery where the existing Test Suite 
  can self-recover from a minor error that occurs in one of it's Tests, 
  typically recovering execution at the next Test in the Test Suite or 
  2) sophisticated recovery that cleans up after the failed Test, resetting 
  appropriate system state including operating system reboot and data restoration 
  if necessary. As in the first approach, the Test Suite then determines the Test 
  that failed and selects the next Test to execute.</p>

      <td width="95%">To implement and verify that the recovery process works as required.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>Depending on the level of sophistication required, it will require effort to 
  implement and stabilize recovery processing. You'll need to allow time to simulate 
  a number of likely (and a few unlikely) failures to prove the recovery processing 
  works.</p>
<p>In the case of automated recovery, both approaches outlined in the previous 
  step have strengths and weaknesses. You should consider carefully the cost of 
  sophisticated automated recovery, both in terms of initial development but also 
  ongoing maintenance effort. Sometimes manual recovery is good enough.</p>


<h3><a name="StabilizeTestSuite">Stabilize the Test Suite</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

        State and Test execution sequences.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
</div>

<p>You should take time to stabilize the Test Suite by one or more trial test 
  executions where possible. The difficulty in achieving stability increases proportionally 
  to the complexity of the Test Suite, and where there is excessively tight coupling 
  between unrelated and and low cohesion between related Tests.</p>
<p>There is the possibility of errors occurring when Tests are executed together 
  within a given Test Suite, that were not encountered when the individual Tests 
  were executed independently. These errors are often the most difficult to track 
  down and diagnose, especially when the are encountered halfway though a length 
  automated test run. Where practical, it's a good idea to rerun the Test Suite 
  regularly as you add additional Tests. This will help you isolate a small number 
  of potential candidate Tests to be diagnosed to identify the problem.</p>

  elements, Implementation Model elements and to one or more measures of Test 
  Coverage.</p>

<br>
</div>

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work 
  was of sufficient value, and that you did not simply consume vast quantities 
  of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and 
  that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make 
  subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists 
  provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people performing the downstream activities that rely on your work 
  as input take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still have 
  time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate 
  your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  them accurately and sufficiently. It may be useful to have the author of the 
  input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  often counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only be partially 
  used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because 
  there is a high probability that the situation surrounding the artifact will 
  change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was created proven incorrect&#151;before 
  the artifact is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid 
  the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content 
  value. In project environments where presentation has importance and economic 
  value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative 
  resource to perform presentation tasks.</p>
