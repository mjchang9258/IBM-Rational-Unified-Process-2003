<p>If the observation and analysis of runtime behavior is to provide the desired 
  insight into the behavior of the software, you will need to give consideration 
  to which execution paths through the application will be of importance to explore 
  and of those, which will offer the most opportunity in understanding the runtime 
  behavior of the software.</p>
<p>In general, the most useful scenario's to explore tend to reflect all or part 
  of those that the end-user will typically use. As such, it is useful whereever 
  possible to identify scenario's by questioning or otherwise consulting with 
  a domain expert such as a representative end-user of the software being developed.</p>
<p>Use cases offer a valuable set of artifacts from which useful scenario's can 
  be identified and explored. As a developer, the most familiar of these will 
  likely be the use-case realizations which you should begin with if available. 
  In the absence of use-case realizations, identify any available use-case scenario's 
  that offer a textual explanation of the path the end user will navigate through 
  the various flows of events in the use-case specification. Finally, the use-case 
  flows of events can be consulted to provide information from which likely candidate 
  scenario's can be identified. The success of this last approach is improved 
  by consultation with a representative for the the uses cases actor or other 
  domain expert.</p>
<p>Testers are another useful resource to consult when attempting to identify 
  useful sceanrio's for runtime analysis. Testers often have insight into and 
  experience with the domain through their testing efforts that evolves them into 
  pseudo-domain experts. In many cases, the stimulus for observing the software's 
  runtime behavior will come from the results of the testing effort itself.</p>
<p>If this activity is driven by a reported defect, the main focus will be to 
  reproduce it in a controlled environment. Based on the information which has 
  been logged when the problem happened, a number of test case have to be identified 
  as potential candidates for making the defect occur reliably. You might need 
  to tweak some of the tests or write new ones, but keep in mind that reproducing 
  the defect is an essential step and for the most difficult cases it will take 
  more time to stabilize the defect than to fix it.</p>

</div>

<p>For runtime execution of the component to yield accurate results, care should 
  be taken to prepare the component satisfactorily so that no anomalous results 
  occur as a by-product of errors in implementation, compilation or linking.</p>
<p>It is often necessary to make use of <i><a href="../glossary.htm#stub" target="_blank">stubbed 
  components</a></i> so that the runtime observation can be completed in a timely 
  manner, or so that it can actually be conducted in situations where the component 
  is reliant on other components that have not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>You will also need to prepare any framework or supporting tools required to 
  execute the component. In some cases this may mean creating driver or harness 
  code to support execution of the component; in other cases it may mean instrumenting 
  the component so that external support tools can observe and possibly control 
  the components behavior.</p>

<p>It is important to consider any requirements and constraints that must be addressed 
  for the target environment in which the runtime analysis will occur. In some 
  cases it will be necessary to simulate one or more of the intended deployment 
  environments in which the component will ultimately be required to run. In other 
  cases, it will be sufficient to perform the observe the runtime behavior on 
  the developers machine.</p>
<p>In any case, it is important to setup the target environment for the runtime 
  observation satisfactorily so that the exercise is not wasted by the inclusion 
  of &quot;contaminants&quot; that will potentially invalidate the subsequent 
  analysis.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the use of tools that generate environmental constraints 
  or exception conditions that are otherwise difficult to reproduce. Such tools 
  are invaluable in isolating failures or anomalies that occur in runtime behavior 
  under these conditions. </p>

<p>Having prepared both the component and the environment it will be observed

<p>Now that you have completed the work, it is a good practice to verify that 
  the work was of sufficient value. You should evaluate whether your work is of 
  appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those team 
  members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, 
  use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are 
  &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Have the people who will use your work as input in performing their downstream 
  activities take part in reviewing your interim work. Do this while you still 
  have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also 
  evaluate your work against the key input artifacts to make sure you have represented 
  or considered them sufficiently and accurately. It may be useful to have the 
  author of the input artifact review your work on this basis.</p>
<p>Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative process and that in many cases 
  artifacts evolve over time. As such, it is not usually necessary&#151;and is 
  in many cases counterproductive&#151;to fully-form an artifact that will only 
  be partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent downstream 
  work. This is because there is a high probability that the situation surrounding 
  the artifact will change&#151;and the assumptions made when the artifact was 
  created proven incorrect&#151;before the artifact is used, resulting in rework 
  and therefore wasted effort.</p>
<p>Also avoid the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment 
  of the value of the content itself. In project environments where presentation 
  has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to 
  consider using an administrative or junior resource to perform work on an artifact 
  to improve it's presentation.</p>
