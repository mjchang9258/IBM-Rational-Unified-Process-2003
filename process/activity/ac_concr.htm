<p>Active objects (that is, instances of active classes) are used
to represent concurrent threads of execution in the system: notionally, each
active object has its own thread of control, and, conventionally, is the root of
an execution stack frame. The mapping of active objects to actual operating
system threads or processes may vary according to responsiveness requirements,
and will be influenced by considerations of context switching overhead. For
example, it is possible for a number of active objects, in combination with a
simple scheduler, to share a single operating system thread, thereby giving the
appearance of running concurrently. However, if any of the active objects
exhibits blocking behavior, for example, by performing synchronous input-output,
then other active objects in the group will be unable to respond to events that
occur while the operating system thread is blocked.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, giving each active object its own operating system thread 
  should result in greater responsiveness, provided the processing resources are 
  not adversely impacted by the extra context switching overhead.</p>

<p class="reactive">In real-time systems, <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_cpsl.htm">Artifact: 
  Capsule</a>s are the recommended way of modeling concurrency; like active classes, 
  each capsule has its own notional thread of control, but capsules have additional 
  encapsulation and compositional semantics to make modeling of complex real-time

<p>This activity defines a process architecture for the system in terms of active 
  classes and their instances and the relationship of these to operating system 
  threads and processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="reactive">Equally, for real-time systems, the process architecture
will be defined in terms of capsules and an associated mapping of these to

<p>During <a href="ac_iddes.htm">Activity: Identify Design Elements</a>,
concurrency requirements driven primarily by naturally occurring demands for
concurrency in the problem domain were considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The result of this was a set of active classes, representing
logical threads of control in the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="reactive">In real-time systems, these active classes are represented
by <a href="../../process/artifact/ar_cpsl.htm">Artifact: Capsule</a>s.</p>

<p> In this step, we consider other
sources of concurrency requirements - those imposed by the non-functional
requirements of the system.</p>
<p>Concurrency requirements are driven by:
<ul>
  <li><b>The degree to which the system must be distributed.</b> A system whose
    behavior must be distributed across processors or nodes virtually requires a
    multi-process architecture. A system which uses some sort of Database
    Management System or Transaction Manager also must consider the processes
    which those major subsystems introduce.</li>
  <li><b>The computation intensity of key algorithms.</b> In order to provide
    good response times, it may be necessary to place computationally intensive
    activities in a process or thread of their own so that the system is still
    able to respond to user inputs while computation takes place, albeit with
    fewer resources.</li>
  <li><b>The degree of parallel execution supported by the environment.</b> If
    the operating system or environment does not support threads (lightweight
    processes) there is little point in considering their impact on the system
    architecture.</li>
  <li><b>The need for fault tolerance in the system</b>. Backup
    processors require backup process, and drive the need to keep primary and
    backup processes synchronized.</li>
  <li><b>The arrival pattern of events in the system. </b>In systems with
    external devices or sensors, the arrival patterns of incoming events may
    differ from sensor to sensor. Some events may be periodic (i.e. occur at a
    fixed interval, plus or minus a small amount) or aperiodic (i.e. with an
    irregular interval). Active classes representing devices which generate different
    event patterns will usually be assigned to different operating system
    threads, with different scheduling algorithms, to ensure that events or
    processing deadlines are not missed (if this is a requirement of the
    system).

  <p class="reactive">This reasoning applies equally to capsules, when used in the design of
    real-time systems.</p>

</ul>
<p>As with many architectural problems, these requirements may be somewhat
mutually exclusive. It is not uncommon to have, at least initially, conflicting
requirements. Ranking requirements in terms of importance will help resolve the
conflict.</p>

<p>The simplest approach is to allocate all active objects to a common thread or
process and use a simple active object scheduler, as this minimizes context-switching overhead. However, in
some cases, it may be
necessary to distribute the active objects across one or more threads or processes.</p>


<p class="reactive">This will almost certainly be the case for most real-time
systems, where the capsules used to represent the logical threads in some cases
have to meet hard scheduling requirements.</p>

<p>If an active object sharing an operating system thread with other active
objects makes a synchronous call to some other process or thread, and this call
blocks the invoking object's shared operating system thread, then this
will automatically suspend all other active objects located in the invoking process.
Now, this does not have to be the case: a call that is synchronous from the point of
view of the active object, may be handled asynchronously from the point of view
of the simple scheduler that controls the group of active objects - the
scheduler suspends the active object making the call (awaiting the completion of
its synchronous call) and then schedules other active
objects to run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the original 'synchronous' operation completes, the invoking active
object can be resumed. However, this approach may not always be possible, because it
may not be feasible for the scheduler to be designed to intercept all
synchronous calls before they block. Note that a synchronous invocation between
active objects using the same operating system process or thread can, for
generality, be handled by the scheduler in this way - and is equivalent in
effect to a procedure call from the point of view of the invoking active object.</p>
<p>This leads us to the conclusion that active objects should be grouped into processes or threads based on their need to run
concurrently with synchronous invocations that block the thread. That is, the only time
an active object should be packaged in the same process or a thread with another object that uses
synchronous invocations that block the thread, is if it does not need to execute concurrently with that
object, and can tolerate being prevented from executing while the other object
is blocked. In the extreme case, when responsiveness is critical, this can lead to
the need for a separate thread or process for
each active object.</p>

<p class="reactive">For real-time systems, the message-based interfaces of capsules mean that it
is simpler to conceive a scheduler that ensures, at least for capsule-to-capsule communications,
that the supporting operating system threads are never
blocked, even when a capsule communicates synchronously with another capsule.
However, it is still possible for a capsule to issue a request directly to the
operating system, for example, for a
synchronous timed wait, that would block the thread.
Conventions have to be established, for lower level services invoked by capsules,
that avoid this behavior, if capsules are to share a common thread (and use a
simple scheduler to simulate concurrency).</p>

<p>As a general rule, in the above situations it is better to use lightweight
threads instead of full-fledged processes since that involves less overhead.
However, we may still want to take advantage of some of the special
characteristics of processes in certain special cases. Since threads share the
same address space, they are inherently more risky than processes. If the
possibility of accidental overwrites is a concern, then processes are preferred.
Furthermore, since processes represent independent units of recovery in most
operating systems, it may be useful to allocate active objects to processes
based on their need to recover independently of each other. That is, all active
objects that need to be recovered as a unit might be packaged together in the
same process.</p>
<p>For each separate flow of control needed by the system, create a process or a
thread (lightweight process). A thread should be used in cases where there is a
need for nested flow of control (i.e. if, within a process, there is a need for
independent flow of control at the sub-task level).</p>
<p>For example, we can say (not necessarily in order of importance) that
separate threads of control may be needed to:
<ul>
  <li>Separate concerns between different areas of the software</li>
  <li>Take advantage of multiple CPUs in a node or multiple nodes in a
    distributed system</li>
  <li>Increase CPU utilization by allocating cycles to other activities when a
    thread of control is suspended</li>
  <li>Prioritize activities</li>
  <li>Support load sharing across several processes and processors</li>
  <li>Achieve a higher system availability by having backup processes</li>
  <li>Support the DBMS, Transaction Manager, or other major subsystems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the Automated Teller Machine, asynchronous events must be
handled coming from three different sources: the user of the system, the ATM
devices (in the case of a jam in the cash dispenser, for example), or the ATM
Network (in the case of a shutdown directive from the network). To handle these
asynchronous events, we can define three separate threads of execution within
the ATM itself, as shown below using active classes in UML.</p>

<p>Each process or thread of control must be created and destroyed. In a
single-process architecture, process creation occurs when the application is
started and process destruction occurs when the application ends. In
multi-process architectures, new processes (or threads) are typically spawned or
forked from the initial process created by the operating system when the
application is started. These processes must be explicitly destroyed as well.</p>
<p>The sequence of events leading up to process creation and destruction must be
determined and documented, as well as the mechanism for creation and deletion.</p>
<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>
<p class="example">In the Automated Teller Machine, one main process is started
which is responsible for coordinating the behavior of the entire system. It in
turn spawns a number of subordinate threads of control to monitor various parts
of the system: the devices in the system, and events emanating from the customer
and from the ATM Network. The creation of these processes and threads can be
shown with <b>active classes</b> in UML, and the creation of instances
of these active classes can be shown in a sequence diagram, as shown below:</p>

<p>Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms enable messages to be sent

<p>Typical inter-process communications mechanisms include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Shared memory</b>, with or without semaphores to ensure
    synchronization.</li>
  <li><b>Rendezvous</b>, especially when directly supported by a

  <li><b>RPC</b> - Remote procedure calls</li>
  <li><b>Event Broadcast</b> - using a &quot;software bus&quot;

</div>

<p>Inter-process communication mechanisms are typically scarce. Semaphores,
shared memory, and mailboxes are typically fixed in size or number and cannot be
increased without significant cost. RPC, messages and event broadcasts soak up
increasingly scarce network bandwidth. When the system exceeds a resource
threshold, it typically experiences non-linear performance degradation: once a
scarce resource is used up, subsequent requests for it are likely to have an
unpleasant effect.</p>
<p>If scarce resources are over-subscribed, there are several strategies to
consider:
<ul>
  <li>reducing the need for the scarce resource by reducing the number of
    processes</li>
  <li>changing the usage of scarce resources (for one or more processes, choose
    a different, less scarce resource to use for the IPC mechanism)</li>
  <li>increasing the quantity of the scarce resource (e.g. increasing the number
    of semaphores). This can be done for relatively small changes, but often has
    side effects or fixed limits.</li>
  <li>sharing the scarce resource (e.g. only allocating the resource when it is
    needed, then letting go when done with it). This is expensive and may only
    forestall the resource crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless what the strategy chosen, the system should degrade gracefully
(rather than crashing), and should provide adequate feedback to a system
administrator to allow the problem to be resolved (if possible) in the field
once the system is deployed.</p>
<p>If the system requires special configuration of the run-time environment in
order to increase the availability of a critical resource (often control by
re-configuring the operating system kernel), the system installation needs to
either do this automatically, or instruct a system administrator to do this
before the system can become operational. For example, the system may need to be
re-booted before the change will take effect.</p>

<p>Conceptual processes must be mapped onto specific constructs in the operating
environment. In many environments, there are choices of types of process, at the
very least usually process and threads. The choices will be base on the degree
of coupling (processes are stand-alone, whereas threads run in the context of an
enclosing process) and the performance requirements of the system (inter-process
communication between threads is generally faster and more efficient than that
between processes).</p>
<p>In many systems, there may be a maximum number of threads per process or
processes per node. These limits may not be absolute, but may be practical
limits imposed by the availability of scarce resources. The threads and
processes already running on a target node need to be considered along with the
threads and processes proposed in the process architecture. The results of the
earlier step, Allocate<a href="#Allocate Inter-Process Coordination Resources">

is done to make sure that a new performance problem is not being created.</p>

&quot;right&quot; amount of concurrency and define the &quot;right&quot; set of
processes:</p>
<h4>Inside-out</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Starting from the Design Model, group classes and subsystems together in
    sets of cooperating elements that (a) closely cooperate with one another and
    (b) need to execute in the same thread of control. Consider the impact of
    introducing inter-process communication into the middle of a message
    sequence before separating elements into separate threads of control.</li>
  <li>Conversely, separate classes and subsystems which do not interact at all,
    placing them in separate threads of control.</li>
  <li>This clustering proceeds until the number of processes has been reduced to
    the smallest number that still allows distribution and use of the physical
    resources.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Outside-in</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Identify external stimuli to which the system must respond. Define a
