<p>This activity adds value only if you are doing business modeling in order to 
  <a href="../glossary.htm#business_engineering">engineer your business</a>. If 
  you are merely building a chart of an existing organization in order to derive 
  system requirements, architecting the business is not necessary. See also <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_scobm.htm">Concepts: 
  Scope of Business Modeling</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Develop Overview of the Business Architecture">Develop an Overview
of the Business Architecture</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The business architecture overview is created early in the lifecycle of a project, 
  possibly as early as the development of the proposal. It is often depicted in 
  graphical form, using some informal notation or storyboarding technique. It 
  represents the intent and idea behind a business modeling effort. The lead business-process 
  analyst produces the business architecture overview, often in collaboration 
  with the project sponsor. </p>
<p>The overview graph must indicate major elements of the business and its environment, 
  such as teams, business tools, and external sources of influence (for example, 
  regulatory bodies, partners, and market segments).&nbsp;The overview graph most 
  often does not focus on the entire business architecture as described here. 
  However, a large effort, such as a business process re-engineering (BPR) project, 
  would consider the entire business architecture. The notion of business architecture 
  is described in <a
href="../workflow/busmodel/co_barch.htm">Concepts: Business Architecture</a>. 
</p>
<p>It is useful to consider the purpose of business architecture and its intended 
  audience. This ensures that the manner in which the business architecture is 
  described and presented will be appropriate for those who must understand it. 
  The intended audience can be categorized into different groups with various 
  concerns. Each of these groups will be interested in different architectural 
  views of the <a href="../artifact/ar_badoc.htm">Artifact: Business Architecture 
  Document</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, the business architecture overview is a provisional first pass. 
  No commitments should be based on this overview diagram. The initial overview 
  graph may or may not be included as part of the <a href="../artifact/ar_badoc.htm">Artifact: 
  Business Architecture Document</a>, depending on what value it adds to the content.</p>
<h3><a name="Describe the Forces Affecting the Business Architecture">Describe 
  the Forces Affecting the Business Architecture</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify the constraints and trends within the business and its environment 
  that could have a significant effect on the structure of the business or the 
  way in which it works. When defining the business architecture, these forces 
  must be analyzed to ensure that the business can adapt to possible changes within 
  a reasonable time and withstand other kinds of impact.&nbsp; Forces that are 
  worth considering include the business strategy and trends, as well as possible 
  future events that would affect every part of the organization or radically 
  change some significant central part of it. In addition, it is important to 
  consider changes that might have to be made very rapidly, along with constraints 
  that might be imposed or lifted in future that may alter the way business is 
  done or open new opportunities.</p>
<p>Consider the probability of these events or changes occurring, and try to visualize 
  their effects on the business. Once you understand the probabilities and effects, 
  you can prioritize these forces and make decisions regarding how to deal with 
  the highest-priority issues. The options available for dealing with each change 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prepare for rapid response to the change.</li>
  <li>Act is if the change has already occurred.</li>
  <li>Minimize the possible effects of the change.</li>
  <li>Ignore the possibility of the change occurring.</li>
</ul>
<p>Document your results in the <a href="../artifact/ar_badoc.htm">Artifact: Business 
  Architecture Document</a>, the section on architectural drivers and constraints.</p>
<h3><a name="Prioritize Business Use Cases">Prioritize Business Use Cases<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Determine which business processes are most critical to explore in order to 
  achieve the goals presented in the <a href="../artifact/ar_bvsio.htm">Artifact: 
  Business Vision Document</a>. Consider the highest-priority and highest-risk 
  business goals, and then look for the business processes that support them. 
  Be sure to look for business use cases or business scenarios from the outlined 
  Business Use-Case Model (in <a href="ac_fbauc.htm">Activity: Find Business Actors 
  and Use Cases</a>) that represent some significant, central capability of the 
  of the target organization or have large architectural coverage. Also consider 
  use cases that employ many architectural elements or illustrate a specific, 
  delicate point of the business architecture.</p>
<p>The selection of business processes (or scenarios, which are parts of business 
  processes) must reflect both <i>coverage</i> and <i>criticality</i>.&nbsp; Coverage 
  is necessary to ensure that enough of the business systems are being considered.&nbsp;Business 
  architecture concerns breadth, and coverage ensures a sufficient amount of it.&nbsp; 
  A few core business processes usually touch the breadth of the organization. 
  Criticality, on the other hand, characterizes the business processes with the 
  highest priority. Priority is derived from important or risky business goals, 
  difficult or complex business processes, and new or vague business processes. 
  Be especially attentive to vague business processes—they might be vague for 
  a reason. Investigating a vague business process often clears up much uncertainty 
  about the way different parts of the organization work together.</p>
<p>Also consider the business goals supported by the business use cases. Business 
  goals that can be relatively easily achieved or offer high returns (that is, 
  most strongly support the business strategy) are a good place to start. The 
  business use cases supporting these business goals may have high priority.</p>
<p>The prioritized business processes or business scenarios should be documented 
  in the business use-case view of the Business Architecture Document. See also 
  <a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm">Guidelines: Business Architecture Document</a>, 
  the section on business process view.<a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm"></a></p>
<h3><a name="Outline the High-Level Organization">Outline the High-Level
Organization</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify the high-level groupings that will constitute the organization. These 
  can be departments, divisions, or business units, depending on what terminology 
  your organization uses. These high-level groupings can be used as input when 
  identifying your initial set of <a href="../artifact/ar_orgu.htm">business systems</a> 
  in the Business Analysis Model (if you have a very large and complex business 
  model).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For key interfaces to customers and (where appropriate) between business systems, 
  the primary <a href="../artifact/ar_bwk.htm">business workers</a> and <a href="../artifact/ar_bent.htm">business 
  entities</a> must be identified.&nbsp;It may also help to define the purpose 
  of each business system and its capabilities. Clear definitions of purpose and 
  capabilities provide a better understanding of the role that the business system 
  must play in business use-case realizations. Such definitions also help reveal 
  the manner in which the business system must interact with other ones.</p>
<p>Consider the scope of the project as defined in the <a href="../artifact/ar_bvsio.htm">Artifact: 
  Business Vision</a>. There is no point in exploring details of parts of the 
  organization that are out of scope. See also <a href="../workflow/busmodel/co_large.htm">Concepts: 
  Modeling Large Organizations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sketches to a high-level organization should be included in the organization 
  structure view of the Business Architecture Document. See also <a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Architecture Document</a>, the section on organization structure view. 
</p>
<h3><a name="Identify Business Systems">Identify Business Systems<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify and briefly describe business systems within the business being modeled. 
  Business systems are really only useful for large, complex business models. 
  Depending on the business-modeling scenario and the scope of your efforts, you 
  might decide against using business systems at all.</p>
<p>A business system represents a relatively independent capability within the 
  organization. It defines a set of responsibilities as well as the business workers, 
  business entities, and business events that undertake these responsibilities. 
  In this way, a business system is a structural part of the organization, like 
  a department, except that the only interactions allowed within a business system 
  are through the predefined responsibilities. Consider, for example, a serving 
  window in a restaurant or an IT support department with a services catalog. 
  In both these examples, there are predefined interactions. What, for example, 
  would happen if you went around to the back of the restaurant to try to get 
  a meal from somebody in the kitchen? Similarly, what would happen if you asked 
  the computer support technician to book you an airline flight? We use business 
  systems to disallow any interactions with the business workers and business 
  entities within it, other than the specified interactions. This allows us to 
  partition large, complex business models so that we can focus on detailing one 
  part of the model without losing sight of where it fits into the whole.</p>
<p>Discuss and obtain agreement regarding which (if any) business systems should 
  be included in your model. Some business systems may be described in only limited 
  detail in the context of the business use-case realizations. Others may provide 
  important input or receive output, in which cases they should be modeled as 
  business actors. This means they are external to the business being modeled.</p>
<p>You may want to indicate how a business system participates in a business use 
  case without showing the internal interactions between business workers and 
  business entities within that business system. Where necessary, you can &quot;zoom 
  into&quot; the business system to show internal collaborations as part of the 
  business use case.</p>
<p>For more information on business systems, see <a href="../modguide/md_orgun.htm">Guidelines:
Business System</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Outline Prioritized Business Use Case Realizations">Outline Prioritized Business Use Case Realizations</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify which <a href="../artifact/ar_bwk.htm">business workers</a> and <a href="../artifact/ar_bent.htm">business 
  entities</a> participate in the execution of each prioritized business use case. 
  They form the <a href="../artifact/ar_bucr.htm">business use-case realization</a> 
  of the business use case.&nbsp;For large, complex business models, business 
  use case realizations can be expressed in terms of interactions between business 
  systems.</p>
<p>The sketches to process realizations must be included in the organization view 
  of the Business Architecture Document. See also the section on organization 
  structure in the <a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm">Guidelines: Business Architecture 
  Document</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Define Geographic View">Define Geographic View<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>This view describes the geographic locations in which the business is deployed, 
  along with the distribution of organizational structure and function across 
  these locations. The locality view is useful for assessing the impact of time 
  and distance on the business processes. Processes may be streamlined, or the 
  organization itself may be restructured to eliminate the overhead of coordinating 
  distributed activities.&nbsp; Furthermore, unique characteristics of each location 
  (such as legislation, resources, accessibility, or image) may affect the decision 
  to deploy certain business activities there. Ships may also be regarded as locations. 
  The process of defining the Geographic View consists of the following activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify the major locations (countries or cities) in which business activities 
    are performed.</li>
  <li>Identify the dependencies and paths of communication between these
    locations.</li>
  <li>Map the business systems (from the Organization View) to these
    locations.</li>
  <li>Assess the positive and negative qualities of each location regarding the
    business activities performed there.</li>
  <li>Assess the overall effects of distribution on the business use cases.</li>
  <li>Explore the effects of streamlining business use cases or restructuring
    the organization to eliminate overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Define Human Resource Aspect View">Define Human Resource and Cultural 
  View</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The process of defining the human resource aspects of the business includes 
  the following activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider the competence profiles that exist within the organization. Define 
    competence profiles that will be required in the future, or define the necessary 
    changes to the existing profiles. Will the future business require employees 
    to be more or less independent? Will they need higher or lower education requirements?</li>
  <li>Discuss education needs. Define both long-term training programs to overcome 
    the differences between current and desired competence profiles, as well as 
    any initial training needs associated with the introduction of new business 
    processes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Define any mechanisms (reward structures, trainee programs, mentor programs, 
    or other incentives) that exist or need to be put in place to enhance skill 
    levels. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.</li>
  <li>Explore the possibility of relocating individuals in the organization due 
    to changes in responsibilities or the need to enhance communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of describing cultural aspects of the business includes the following 
  activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the characteristics of the culture.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Determine which of these characteristics are key to the organization and 
    must be left undisturbed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Discuss which characteristics must change.</li>
  <li>Determine what mechanisms are in place to maintain and encourage the culture. 
    Discuss ideas for new or changed mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Define a path to be taken to introduce any changes that you deem necessary.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of this step should be documented in the Human Resource View of 
  the Business Architecture Document. See also <a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Architecture Document</a>, the section on human resource view.&nbsp;</p>
