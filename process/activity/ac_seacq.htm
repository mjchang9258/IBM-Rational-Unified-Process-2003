<p>Many of the steps in the process can only be efficiently carried on with the
proper tool support. Tools need to be selected that fit the particular needs of
an organization, based mostly on specific activities or artifacts necessary for
the process. The <a href="../workflow/environm/co_tools.htm">Concepts:
Supporting Tools</a> gives a brief overview of the different kinds of supporting
tools that a project needs.</p>
<p>Sometimes special tools have to be developed internally to support special
needs, provide additional automation of tedious or error-prone tasks, and
provide better integration between tools. This tool development may proceed with
a lighter weight process than the one used for developing the product.</p>
<p>Selecting and acquiring the tools is done in hand-in-hand with the implementation 
  of the process in the organization. See <a href="../workflow/environm/co_iproj.htm">Concept. 
  Implementing a Process in a Project</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_tools__selecting"></a><a name="XE_selecting_tools"></a><a name="Identify Needs">Identify
Needs</a> and Constraints <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Identify what the needs for tool support are, and what the constraints are,
by looking at the following:
<ul>
  <li>The development process. What tool support is required to effectively
    work. For example, if the organization decide to employ an iterative
    development process, it is necessary to automate the tests, since you will
    be testing several times during the project.</li>
  <li>Host (or development) platform(s).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Target platform(s).</li>
  <li>The programming language(s) to be used.</li>
  <li>Existing tools. Evaluate any existing and proven tools and decide whether
    they can continue to be used.</li>
  <li>The distribution of the development organization. Is the organization
    physically distributed? Development tools generally support a physically
    distributed organization differently.</li>
  <li>The size of the development effort. Tools support large organizations more
    or less well.</li>
  <li>Budget and time constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Development-Organization Assessment will provide good input.&nbsp;
<h3><a name="Collect Information about Tools">Collect Information about Tools</a>
<a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Collect information about the candidate tools and their vendors. Some of this
information is data that can be collected from the vendor, or from independent
reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h4>Tool Features and Functions</h4>
<p>Create a list of features and functions for the type of tool you are
studying. In most cases the tool vendors provide such lists.&nbsp;The table
below shows a fraction of a list for configuration management tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To combine the factors and select the best tools is not a trivial issue. To
help you make a decision we recommend that you create a table for the features.</p>
<h4>Compare Features and Functions</h4>
<p>Using the list of features and functions, decide how important each feature
or function is for you. The following ranking can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>'<b>Must</b>'. The tool must have this feature.</li>
  <li>'<b>Nice</b>'. The feature would be nice to have, but it is not critical.</li>
  <li>'<b>Not required</b>'. It does not matter whether to tool has the feature
    or not.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Indicate for each tool whether it has the feature or not using the following
symbols:</p>
<div align="center">

<h4>Compare Tool and Vendors Criteria</h4>
<p>You need to compare the tools in all other factors, except the features. To
get an overview of the tools, we recommend that you document the overview in a
table, such as the table below. Briefly describe your needs and constraints for
each factor. Give each factor a weight to indicate how important this factor is
to you. For example, use a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 means that the factor is
very important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grade each tool (and vendor) in the following criteria. You can use a scale
from 1 to 5:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Useless in this area</li>
  <li>Weak or has some serious shortcomings.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Adequate in this area.</li>
  <li>Better than average in this area.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Excellent in this area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Document the comparison in a table such as the following table.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Select Tools">Select Tools</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Select the tools that best fulfill your needs, and can fit within your
constraints. Do not fall into the trap of comparing features and functions only.
The other criteria are equally, or more important. Unless the choice of tool is
obvious, we recommend that you test the tool (or tools) that you have found to
best suit your needs, before you decide to acquire it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are any doubts about the tool, the best is always to test the tool.
You can also try to find other companies that are using the tool, and ask them
if they can evaluate the tool. You can also ask for reference customers from the
vendors; other customers who are using the tool. There is also information
available on the internet, where for example online magazines publish their
reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have made the choice, stick to it. To change tool in the middle of a
project is often very costly.</p>
<h3><a name="AcquireTools">Acquire Tools</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To acquire tools is a non-trivial issue, which involves legal matters as well
as financial matters. Tool acquisition is not covered in any detail here. The
following areas should be considered: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation. How much assistance do they offer to set up the tools?</li>
  <li>Support. What kind of support do the vendor offer? Many tool vendors offer
    several grades of support to choose from. The more you pay the better
    support you get.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Vendor commitment. How committed is the vendor to you as a new customer?
    If you run into problems with the tool, what kind of help can they offer? In
    what time-frame and to what cost?</li>
  <li>Influence. What influence will you have on the future of the tool? How
    will your need be prioritized?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Maintenance. How does the vendor handle bugs in the tool? Are there
    planned &quot;service pack&quot; releases?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Training. What training do they offer? What is the availability of
    training courses?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Product future. Is there a plan that describes the future evolvement of
    the tool?</li>
  <li>Licensing. Should you buy one site license for all project members, or
    should you buy one tool per individual? Some tools offer
    &quot;floating&quot; licenses, which sets a limit to the number of
    concurrent users in an organization.</li>
</ul>
