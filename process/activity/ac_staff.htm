<h3><a name="Staff the Project">Staff the Project</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The Project Manager will have determined the staffing needs for the iteration
in <a href="ac_dfpos.htm">Activity: Define Project Organization and Staffing</a>,
and will look to the Human Resources function of the organization to provide
staff with the needed domain, skills and experience profiles. Most organizations
do not have the luxury of keeping a large pool of staff on stand-by for
projects, and project starts do not always neatly synchronize with the
termination of previous projects. Frequently then, except for a few staff
engaged on the project from the outset, many will need to be hired. This may be
a lengthy process, so the prudent Project Manager will always be looking ahead,
and initiating the acquisition of staff for future iterations as well as the
current one. It may be possible to cover shortfalls by working overtime or by
the use of contract rather than permanent staff. Both these solutions have
disadvantages, and any systematic and persistent shortfall in staff levels is a
serious risk to schedule.</p>
<h3><a name="Map Staff Skills to Workers">Map Staff Skills to Roles</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A role defines the behavior and responsibilities of an
individual, or a set of individuals working together, in the business. The
behavior of each role is defined as a set of activities. The responsibilities
of each role are usually defined relative to certain artifacts, such as
documents, for example. Examples of roles are designer, software architect, and
reviewer. Through the associated set of activities, the role also implicitly
defines a <b>competence</b>.</p>
<p>Note that roles are not individuals; instead, they describe how individuals
should behave in the business, and what responsibilities these individuals have.</p>
<p>The project typically has at its disposal a number of <b>resources</b>,
individuals which have specific competencies. For example, Joe, Marie, Paul,
Sylvia are individuals with different, although overlapping competencies. Using
the roles defined in the process, map resources available to the project onto roles they can play.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../manuals/intro/images/wk_assgn.gif" width="471" height="230"></p>
<p>The association of individual to role is dynamic over time, driven by the
phase in the project lifecycle and the work to be performed.
<ul>
  <li>An individual might act as several different roles in the same day: For
    example, Sylvia might be a Reviewer in the morning, and a Use-Case Designer
    in the afternoon.</li>
  <li>An individual might act as several roles simultaneously: For example,
    Jane could be both the Software Architect and the Designer of a certain class, and
    also the Package Owner of the package that contains this class.</li>
  <li>Several people can act as the same role to perform a certain activity
    together, acting as a team: For example, Paul and Mary could be both
    Use-Case Designers of the same use case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to allocate responsibilities so that there is as little hand-off of
artifacts from one resource to another: have the same person or team design and
implement a subsystem, so that they do not have to re-learn work already done by
others.</p>
<p>When the same team designs as well as implements, there is a smooth
transition from design to implementation. In addition, it makes for better
designers: by learning what works and what does not, they gain a better sense of
good design and incorporate it into future work. Like a sculptor, the good
designer must understand the medium of expression, which for software is the
implementation environment.</p>
<h3><a name="Form Teams">Form Teams</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The shape of the project organization and the required staffing levels for 
  the iteration have been decided by the Project Manager in <a href="ac_dfpos.htm">Activity: 
  Define Project Organization and Staffing</a>. With the knowledge of actual resource 
  availability, it remains to fine-tune this structure and assign staff to it. 
  The Project Manager should reexamine any team of more than seven staff to see 
  if there is some architecturally sensible way in which it may be split, say 
  along subsystem lines.</p>
<p>Teams should consist of a minimum of two people and a maximum of about seven;
teams with more than seven people usually naturally split themselves into
sub-teams, so it's best to do it for them to make life simpler.</p>
<p>In assigning staff to teams, the Project Manager should be sensitive to the
overall experience and familiarity level of the team, and try to create teams
with a mix of 'new blood' and staff who have been with the project for some
time. At the beginning of a project, the Project Manager will have to rely on
blending experienced staff with more junior staff.</p>
<h3><a name="Train Project Staff">Train Project Staff</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>In many cases, an inventory of the competencies of the resources available to
the project will reveal gaps in the assignment of team members to roles
(assuming that the normal course of trying to recruit additional team members or
hire external contractors has already been tried). In this case, skills will
need to be developed. Appropriate training and mentoring must be obtained for
these people, in advance of but in close proximity to the time when they will
need the skills. Training not put to practice immediately rapidly decays. Often,
the combination of formal training followed by a mentor-led workshop to
'jump-start' an activity is particularly effective at putting the new skills to
work.</p><br>
