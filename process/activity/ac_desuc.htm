<p>Start by reviewing and refining the scenarios that you will be dealing with 
  in the development cycle. These may have already been initially identified in 
  the <a href="ac_facuc.htm">Activity: Find Actors and Use Cases</a>. Use these 
  enumerated scenarios as a starting point in determining the scope of what flows 
  will need to be described.</p>
<p><a href="../artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">Storyboards</a> will help you in understanding 
  and detailing the use case flows. 
  Another input to consider is the <a href="../artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">user-interface 
  prototype</a>, if one has already been developed.</p>



<h3><a name="DetailFlowOfEvents">Detail the Flow of Events</a> <a name="XE_flow_of_events__detailing"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>You should already have a outlined, step-by-step description of the use-case 
  flow of events. This is also created in the <a href="ac_facuc.htm">Activity: 
  Find Actors and Use Cases</a>. Use this step-by-step outline as a starting point, 
  and gradually make it more detailed.</p>
<p>Describe use cases according to the standards decided for the project 
  (documented 
  in the <a href="../artifact/ar_projspecgls.htm">Use-Case Modeling Guidelines</a>). 
  Decide on the following points before describing the use cases so that you are 
  consistent across use cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does the use case start? The start of the use case must clearly describe 
    the signal that activates the use case. Write, for example, &quot;The use 
    case can start when … happens.&quot;</li>
  <li>How does the use case terminate? You should clearly state whatever happens 
    in the course of the flow to terminate the use case. Write, for example, &quot;When 
    … happens, the use case terminates.&quot;</li>
  <li>How does the use case interact with actors? To minimize any risk of misunderstanding 
    say exactly what will reside inside the system, and what will reside outside 
    the system. Structure the description as a series of paragraphs, in which 
    each paragraph expresses an action in the format: &quot;When the actor does 
    …, the system does ….&quot; You can also emphasize interaction by writing 
    that the use case sends and receives signals from actors, for example: &quot;The 
    use case starts when it receives the signal 'start' from the Operator.&quot;</li>
  <li>How does the use case exchange data with an actor? If you like, you can 
    refer to the arguments of the signals, but it might be better to write, for 
    example, &quot;The use case starts when the User logs into the system by giving 
    his name and password.&quot;</li>
  <li>How does the use case repeat some behavior? You should try to express this 
    in natural language. However, in exceptional cases, it might be worthwhile 
    to use code-like constructs, such as &quot;WHILE-END WHILE,&quot; &quot;IF-THEN-ELSE,&quot; 
    and &quot;LOOP-END LOOP,&quot; if the corresponding natural language terms 
    are difficult to express. In general, however, you should avoid using such 
    code-like constructs in use-case descriptions because they are hard to read 
    and maintain.</li>
  <li>Are there any optional situations in a use case's flow of events? Sometimes 
    an actor is presented with several options. This should be written in the 
    same way. For example: 
    <p>&quot;The actor chooses one of the following, one or more times:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>a) . . .</p>
      <p>b) . . .</p>
      <p>c) . . .&quot; etc.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How should the use case be described so that the customer and the users 
    can understand it? The use of methodology-specific terminology, such as use 
    case, actor, and signal, might make the text unnecessarily hard to grasp. 
    To make the text easier to read, you might enumerate the actions, or adopt 
    some other strategy. Whatever strategy you use should be specified in the 
    general use-case-modeling guidelines so that you keep it in mind during the 
    entire activity of describing use cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Concentrate on describing what is done in the use case, not how specific problems 
  internal to the system should be solved. When working with object models, you 
  may have to complement the description with details about how things work, so 
  do not make the description overly detailed at this point. Describe only what 
  you believe will be stable later on.</p>
<p>If a use case's flow of events has become too encompassing or complex, or if 
  it appears to have parts that are independent of one another, split it into 
  two or more use cases.</p>
<p>When you write the descriptive text, refer to the glossary. As fresh terms 
  evolve from new concepts, include them in the glossary. Do not change the definition 
  of a term without informing the appropriate project members.</p>

<h5>The Content of a Flow of Events Description</h5>
<p>A flow of events description explores:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How and when the use case starts.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">&quot;The use case can start when the function 'Administer 
  Order' is activated by a user.&quot;</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the use case interacts with the actors, and what data they exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">&quot;To create a new order, the user activates the function 
  'New' and then specifies the following mandatory data concerning the order: 
  name, network elements (at least one), and type of measurement function. Optional 
  data can also be specified concerning the order: a comment (a small textual 
  description). The user then activates the function 'OK,' and a new order is 
  created in the system.&quot;</p>
  
<p>Note: You must be explicit regarding the data exchanged between the actors 
  and the use case; otherwise, the customer and the users will probably not understand 
  the use-case description.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How and when the use case uses data stored in the system, or stores data 
    in the system.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">&quot;The user activates the function 'Modify' to modify an 
  existing order, and specifies an order number (small integer). The system then 
  initializes an order form with the name of the order, its network elements, 
  and its type of measurement function. This data is retrieved from a secondary 
  storage device.&quot; 

<ul>
  <li>How and when the use case ends.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">&quot;The use case ends when the function 'Exit' is activated 
  by the Orderer.&quot;</p>

<p>You should also describe odd or exceptional flows of events. An exceptional 
  flow is a subflow of the use case that does not adhere to the use case's normal 
  or basic behavior. This flow may nevertheless be necessary in any complete description 
  of the use case's behavior. A typical example of an exceptional flow is the 
  one given in the first example. If the use case receives some unexpected data 
  (that the actor is not the one expected in that particular context) it terminates. 
  Having the wrong actor and terminating prematurely are not in the typical flow 
  of events.</p>
<p>Other &quot;do's and don'ts&quot; to consider when you describe a use case 
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the flow of events, not just the use case's functionality or
    purpose.</li>
  <li>Describe only flows that belong to the use case, not what is going on in
    other use cases that work in parallel with it.</li>
  <li>Do not mention actors who do not communicate with the use case in
    question.</li>
  <li>Do not provide too much detail when you describe the use case's
    interaction with any actor.</li>
  <li>If the order of the subflows described for the use case does not have to
    be fixed, do not describe it as if it does have to be fixed.</li>
  <li>Use the terms in the common glossary and consider the following in writing
    the text:</li>
  <li>Use straightforward vocabulary. Don't use a complex term when a simple one
    will do.</li>
  <li>Write short, concise sentences.</li>
  <li>Avoid adverbs, such as very, more, rather, and the like.</li>
  <li>Use correct punctuation.</li>
  <li>Avoid compound sentences.</li>
</ul>

  the discussions on <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#Flow of Events - Contents">contents</a> 
  and <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#Flow of Events - Style">style</a> of the 
  flow of events.</p>

<h3><a name="StructureFlowOfEvents">Structure the Flow of Events</a> <a name="XE_use_case__structuring_the_flow_of_events_of"></a><a name="XE_flow_of_events__structuring"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A use case's flow of events can be divided into several subflows. When the 
  use case is activated the subflows can combine in various ways if the following 
  holds true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use case can proceed from one of several possible paths, depending on 
    the input from a given actor, or the values of some attribute or object. For 
    example, an actor can decide, from several options, what to do next, or, the 
    flow of events may differ if a value is less or greater than a certain value.</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>Example:</b></h5>
<p class="example">Part of the description of the use case Withdraw Money in an 
  automated teller machine system could be &quot;The amount of money the client 
  wants to withdraw from the account is compared to the balance of the account. 
  If the amount of money exceeds the balance, the client is informed and the use 
  case terminates. Otherwise, the money is withdrawn from the account.&quot; 

<ul>
  <li>The use case can perform some subflows in optional sequences.</li>
  <li>The use case can perform several subflows at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must describe all these optional or alternative flows. It is recommended 
  that you describe each subflow in a separate supplement to the Flow of Events 
  section, and should be mandatory for the following cases: 
<ul>
  <li>Subflows that occupy a large segment of a given flow of events.</li>
  <li>Exceptional flows of events. This helps the use case's basic flow of
    events to stand out more clearly.</li>
  <li>Any subflow that can be executed at several intervals in the same flow of 
    events.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a subflow involves only a minor part of the complete flow of events, it 
  is better to describe it in the body of the text.</p>

<h5><b>Example:</b></h5>
<p class="example">&quot;This use case is activated when the function 'administer 
  order' is called for by either of the actors Orderer or Performance Manager 
  Administrator. If the signal does not come from one of these actors, the use 
  case will terminate the operation and display an appropriate message to the 
  user. However, if the actor is recognized, the use case proceeds by.....&quot;</p>

<p>You can illustrate the structure of the flow of events with an activity diagram, 
  see <a href="../modguide/md_actd.htm">Guidelines: Activity Diagram in the Use-Case 
  Model</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="IllustrateRelationships">Illustrate Relationships with Actors and 
  Other Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Create use-case diagrams showing the use case and its relationships to actors 
  and other use cases. A diagram of this type functions as a local diagram of 
  the use case, and should be related to it. Note that this kind of local use-case 
  diagram is typically of little value, unless the use case has use-case relationships 
  that need to be explained, or if there is an unusual complexity among the actors 
  involved.</p>

<p>Any requirements that can be related to the use case, but that are not taken 
  into consideration in the Flow of Events of the use case, should be described 
  in the Special Requirements of the use case. Such requirements are likely to 
  be nonfunctional.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#Special Requirements">Guidelines: 
  Use Case, special requirements</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="DefineCommunicationProtocols">Define Communication Protocol(s)</a> 
  <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Define the communication protocol to be used for any actor that is another 
  system or external hardware. If some existing protocol (especially recognized 
  protocols or protocols considered standard) is to be used, the description of 
  the use case should simply name the protocol. If the protocol is new, you should 
  point to where the protocol definition can be found which will need to be fully 
  described during object-model development.</p>

<h3><a name="DescribePreconditions">Describe Preconditions</a> <a name="XE_use_case__describing_precondition_of"></a><a name="XE_precondition__describing_for_a_use_case"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A precondition on a use case explains the state the system must be in order 
  for the use case to be possible to start.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>
<p class="example">In order for an ATM system to be able to dispense cash, the 
  following preconditions must be satisfied:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The ATM network must be accessible.</li>
    <li>The ATM must be in a state ready to accept transactions.</li>
    <li>The ATM must have at least some cash on hand that it can dispense.</li>
    <li>The ATM must have enough paper to print a receipt for at least one transaction.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="example">These would all be valid preconditions for the use case Dispense 
  Cash.</p>
  
<p>Take care to describe the system state; avoid describing the detail of other 
  incidental activities that may have taken place prior to this use case.</p>
<p>Preconditions are not used to create a sequence of use cases. There will never 
  be a case where you have to first perform one use case, then another, in order 
  to have a meaningful flow of events. If you feel there is a need to do this, 
  it is likely that you have decomposed the use-case model too much. Correct this 
  problem by combining the sequentially dependent use cases into a single use 
  case. If this makes the resulting&nbsp; use case too complex, consider techniques 
  for structuring use cases, as presented in <a href="#StructureFlowOfEvents">Structure 
  the Flow of Events of the Use Case</a> above, or in the<a href="ac_stucm.htm"> 
  Activity: Structure the Use-Case Model</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#preconditions and Postconditions">Guidelines: 
  Use Case, Preconditions and Postconditions</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="DescribePostconditions">Describe Postconditions</a> <a name="XE_postcondition__describing_for_a_use_case"></a><a name="XE_use_case__describing_postcondition_of"></a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A postcondition on a use case lists possible states the system can be in at 
  the end of the use case. The system must be in one of those states at the end 
  of the execution of the use case. It is also used to state actions that the 
  system performs at the end of the use case, regardless of what occurred in the 
  use case.</p>

<h5>Example<b>:</b></h5>
<p class="example">If the ATM always displays the &#145;Welcome&#146; message 
  at the end of a use case, this could be documented in the postcondition of the 
  use case.</p>
<p class="example">Similarly, if the ATM always closes the customer’s transaction 
  at the end of a use case like Withdraw Cash, regardless of the course of events 
  taken, that fact should be recorded as a postcondition for the use case.</p>
<p class="example">Postconditions are used to reduce the complexity and improve 
  the readability of the flow-of-events of the use case.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should postconditions be used to create a sequence of 
  use cases. There should never be a case where you have to first perform one 
  use case, then another, in order to have a meaningful flow of events. If you 
  feel a need to do this, the sequentially dependent use cases should be combined 
  into a single use case. If this makes the combined use case too complex, consider 
  techniques for structuring use cases, as presented in Structure the Flow of 
  Events of the Use Case above, or in the <a href="ac_stucm.htm">Activity: Structure 
  the Use-Case Model</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#preconditions and Postconditions">Guidelines: 
  Use Case, Preconditions and Postconditions</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="DescribeExtensionPoints">Describe Extension Points</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>If the use case is to be extended by another use case (see <a href="../modguide/md_exrel.htm">Guidelines: 
  Extend-Relationship</a>), you need to describe what the extension points are 
  (see <a href="../modguide/md_uc.htm#Extension Points">Guidelines: Use Case, 
  extension points</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="EvaluateyourResults">Evaluate Your Results</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Review and discuss the use case with the stakeholders, so that they have a 
  clear understanding of the use case and agree on its description.</p>
<p>The use-case description is complete only when it describes everything the 
  use case performs, implements, or otherwise allows from beginning to end. Before 
  you finish, check that the use case exhibits the properties that characterize 
  it as a &quot;good&quot; use case. See checkpoints for use cases and use-case 
  reports in <a href="ac_rvucm.htm">Activity: Review Requirements</a>.</p>
