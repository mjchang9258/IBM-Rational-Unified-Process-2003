<h3><a name="XE_business_worker__identifying"></a><a name="Identify Business Workers">Identify
Business Workers</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>For each role (human or system) in the organization, identify a business worker 
  and give it a brief description. Employment positions are a good place to start, 
  but be aware that a person in a specific position is usually required to fulfill 
  more than one role and that various roles are often filled by people in different 
  positions. You can also look at the software systems currently being used. However, 
  you must be aware that—like people—many software systems perform multiple roles 
  within the organization. This integration of sometimes completely different 
  roles is one of the factors that makes software maintenance so difficult and 
  locks a business in to a system.</p>
<p>After you have identified your business workers, walk through each business 
  use case and state which business workers are involved in which steps. This 
  ensures that no business workers have been missed and that the ones that you 
  have listed are all &quot;inside&quot; the part of the business you are modeling. 
</p>
<p>For more information on business workers, see <a href="../modguide/md_bwk.htm">Guidelines:
Business Worker</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_entity__identifying"></a><a name="Identify Business Entities">Identify
Business Entities</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To find candidate business entities, consider what information each business 
  worker handles. The information that must be queried, validated, created, or 
  communicated is a good starting point. Only significant, persistent information 
  should be considered as a business entity.</p>
<p>To show how business entities need to &quot;know about&quot; one another, use 
  associations (see <a href="../modguide/md_basso.htm">Guidelines: Associations 
  in the Business Analysis Model</a>). Give the associations role names for clarification.</p>
<p>If business entities have clear whole-part relationships, show that fact with 
  aggregation-relationships (see <a href="../modguide/md_baggr.htm">Guidelines: 
  Aggregations in the Business Analysis Model</a>).</p>
<p>If business entities are specializations or generalizations of one another, 
  use generalization-relationships to show this (see <a href="../modguide/md_bgen.htm">Guidelines: 
  Generalizations in the Business Analysis Model</a>). It is often wise to wait 
  to establish generalizations until after you have worked on describing the business 
  entities (see <a href="ac_dent.htm">Activity: Detail a Business Entity</a>).</p>
<p>Document the relationships in class diagrams (see <a href="../modguide/md_bactdbom.htm#ClassDiagrams">Guidelines:
Class Diagram in the Business Analysis Model</a>).</p>
<p>Walk through the workflow of each business use case to ensure that no business 
  entities have been forgotten. Also, make sure that the ones you have identified 
  are actually participating in a workflow.</p>
<p>For more information on business entities, see <a href="../modguide/md_bent.htm">Guidelines:
Business Entity</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_entity__identifying"></a><a name="Identify Business Events">Identify
Business Events<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Inspect the interactions between business actors, business workers, and business 
  entities. Business actors may initiate a business use case by sending a business 
  event. Business workers may send business events to business actors or to each 
  other. If a message between two business workers has one of the following characteristics, 
  it might be a business event:</p>
<ul>
	
  <li>The sender of the message does not need to wait for the receiver to process 
    the message.</li>
	
  <li>There is a significant lapse of time between when the message is sent and 
    when it is received.</li>
	
  <li>There is a significant physical distance between sender and receiver.</li>
	
  <li>The receiver is in another business system. In this case, the business event 
    must be sent to the business system and not directly to the business worker 
    within it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Business events may also be used to send signals between business systems and business use cases.</p>
<p>For more information on business events, see <a href="../modguide/md_bevnt.htm">Guidelines:
Business Event</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_use-case_realization__defining"></a><a name="Define Business Use Case Realizations">Define 
  Business Use-Case Realizations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>For each business use case, create a Business Use-Case Realization in the Business 
  Analysis Model. The name of the Business Use-case Realization must be the same 
  as the associated business use case. Furthermore, a realization-relationship 
  should be established from the business use case realization to its associated 
  business use case.</p>
<p>Identify which business workers and business entities participate in the execution 
  of each business use case. They form the business use-case realization of the 
  business use case.</p>
<p>Present the business workers and business entities of the business use-case 
  realization in a sequence diagram (see <a href="../modguide/md_bactdbom.htm#SequenceDiagrams">Guidelines: 
  Sequence Diagram in the Business Analysis Model</a>). Show only those interactions 
  that are necessary an understanding of how the business workers and entities 
  perform this business use-case realization workflow. There should be at least 
  one interaction (sequence diagram) for every flow described in the business 
  use case.</p>
<p>Instead of using a sequence diagram, you can present the participating business 
  workers and business entities in a collaboration diagram (see <a href="../modguide/md_bactdbom.htm#CollaborationDiagrams">Guidelines: 
  Collaboration Diagram in the Business Analysis Model</a>). Sequence diagrams 
  are superior for large and complex interactions, while collaboration diagrams 
  provide a better overview of relationships between participants.</p>
<p>To clarify the meaning of the collaboration diagrams, you can describe the 
  workflow of each business use-case realization in terms of its elements—the 
  interacting business workers handling business entities. This is optional, and 
  it only adds value for more complex workflows or parts of workflows. To perform 
  this activity:
<ul>
  <li>Describe the normal workflow of the business use-case realization.</li>
  <li>Describe any alternative and optional workflows.</li>
  <li>Define performance goals in terms of cost and lead times for business
    workers and business entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on business use-case realizations, see <a href="../modguide/md_bucr.htm">Guidelines: 
  Business Use Case Realization</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_object_model__structuring"></a><a name="Structure the Business Analysis Model">Structure
the Business Analysis Model</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Analyze the lifecycle of each business entity. Each one should be created and 
  removed by someone during the life of a business. Make sure that each business 
  entity is accessed and used by a business worker or another business entity. 
  Do this by creating a matrix or generating a report showing which business workers 
  create and use the business entities.</p>
<p>Reduce the number of workers. As you develop your models, it is likely that 
  you will find one or more too many workers per use-case realization. Make sure 
  that each business worker corresponds to a set of tasks that one person typically 
  would do, even though those tasks are divided among more than one business use 
  case. You can do this by deriving and examining the responsibilities required 
  of the business worker from all business use-case realizations in which the 
  business worker participates.</p>
<p>Each business entity should have an owner—that is, someone who is responsible 
  for it. You can model this with an association from the business worker to the 
  business entities for which the business worker is responsible. Some business 
  entities might be owned by people outside the business. If that is the case, 
  make sure that it is mentioned in the brief description of the business entity.</p>
<p>For very large or complex business models, you can use <a href="../artifact/ar_orgu.htm">Business 
  Systems</a> for structuring and partitioning. In this case, you can assign business 
  workers, business entities, and business events to a business system. Make sure 
  that the relationships and responsibilities defined by the business systems 
  support the interactions between the business workers, entities, and events. 
  If necessary, the business systems must be slightly adjusted (in consultation 
  with the business process analyst), or the interactions must be refined.</p>
<p>For guidelines on structuring the Business Analysis Model and naming business
workers and business entities, see <a href="../modguide/md_bom.htm">Guidelines:
Business Analysis Model</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Evaluate Your Results">Evaluate Your Results</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Evaluate the business use-case realization workflow, along with the text and 
  diagrams documenting it. One way to do this is to conduct a walkthrough. In 
  this method of evaluation, the person responsible for the business use-case 
  realization leads some of the members of the team through the business use-case 
  realization workflow. Another technique is to do <a href="../workguid/wg_rlpl.htm">role-playing</a>, 
  in which team members act as business actors, business workers, and business 
  entities.</p>
