<p>Use Cases form the central focus of most of the early analysis and design work. 

  To enable the transition between Requirements-centric activities and Analysis/Design-centric 

  activities, the <a href="../artifact/ar_ucrea.htm">Artifact: Use-Case Realization</a>

</div>



<p>The description of each use case is not always sufficient for finding

analysis classes and their objects. The customer generally finds information

about what happens inside the system uninteresting, so the use-case descriptions

may leave such information out. In these cases, the use-case description reads

like a &#145;black-box&#146; description, in which internal details on what the system

does in response to an actor’s actions is either missing or very summarily

described. To find the objects which perform the use case, you need to have the

&#145;white box&#146; description of what the system does from an internal

perspective.</p>

<p class="exampleheading">Example</p>

<p class="example">In the case of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), the

customer of the system may prefer to say

<ul>

  <p class="example">&quot;The ATM validates the Bank Customer’s card.&quot;</p>

</ul>

<p class="example">To describe the user authentication behavior of the system.

While this may be sufficient for the customer, it gives us no real idea of what

really happens inside the ATM to validate the card.</p>

<p class="example">In order to form an internal picture of how the system really

works, at a sufficient level of detail to identify objects, we may need

additional information. Taking the ATM card validation activity as an example,

the expanded description would read as:

<ul>

  <p class="example">&quot;The ATM sends the customer’s account number and the

  PIN to the ATM Network to be validated. The ATM Network returns success if the

  customer number and the PIN match and the customer is authorized to perform

  transactions, otherwise the ATM Network returns failure.&quot;</p>

</ul>

<p class="example">This level of detail gives us a clear idea of what

information is required (account number and PIN) and who is responsible for the

authentication (the ATM Network, an actor in the Use Case model). From this

information, we can identify two potential objects (a Customer object, with

attributes of account number and PIN, and an ATM Network Interface) as well as

their responsibilities.</p>

<p>Examine the use-case<b> </b>description to see if the internal behavior 

  of the system is clearly defined. The internal behavior of the system should 

  be unambiguous, so that it is clear what the system must do. It is not necessary 

  to define the elements within the system (objects) that are responsible for 

  performing that behavior – just a clear definition of what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Sources of information for this detail include domain experts who can help

define what the system needs to do. A good question to ask, when considering a

particular behavior of the system, is &quot;what does it mean for the system to

do that thing?&quot;. If what the system does to perform the behavior is not

well defined enough to answer that question, there is likely more information

that needs to be uncovered.</p>

<p>The following alternatives exist for supplementing the description of the <b>Flow

of Events</b>:

<ul>
  <li><b>Do not describe it at all</b>. This might be the case if you think the 
    interaction diagrams are self-explanatory, or if the <b>Flow of Events</b> 
    of the corresponding use case provides a sufficient description.</li>
  <li><b>Supplement the existing Flow of Event description</b>. Add supplementary 
    descriptions to the <b>Flow of Events</b> in areas where the existing text 
    is unclear about the actions the system should take.</li>
  <li><b>Describe it as a complete textual flow</b>, separate from the &quot;external&quot; 
    Use Case Flow of Events description. This is appropriate in cases where the 
    internal behavior of the system bears little resemblance to the external behavior 
    of the system. In this case, a completely separate description, associated 
    with the use-case realization rather than the use case, is warranted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a candidate set of analysis classes is the first step in the transformation 

  of the system from a mere statement of required behavior to a description of 

  how the system will work. In this effort, analysis classes are used to represent 

  the roles of model elements which provide 

  the necessary behavior to fulfill the functional requirements specified by use 

  cases and the non-functional requirements specified by the supplemental requirements. 

  As the project focus shifts to design, these roles evolve a set of design elements 

  which realize the use cases.</p>

<p>The roles identified in Use-Case Analysis primarily express behavior of the

upper-most layers of the system - application-specific behavior and domain

specific behavior. Boundary classes and control classes typically evolve into

application-layer design elements, while entity classes evolve into

domain-specific design elements. Lower layer design element typically evolve

from the analysis mechanisms which are used by the analysis classes identified

here.</p>

<p>The technique described here uses three different perspectives of the system

to drive the identification of candidate classes. The three perspectives are

that of the <b>boundary </b>between the system and its actors, the

information the system uses, and the control logic of the system. The

corresponding class stereotypes, boundary, entity and control, are conveniences

used during Analysis that disappear in Design.</p>

<p>Identification of classes means just that: they should be identified, named,

and described briefly in a few sentences.</p>

Analysis Class</a>. For more information on use-case realizations, see <a href="../modguide/md_ucrea.htm">Guidelines:

Use-Case Realization</a>.</p>

<p>If particular analysis mechanisms and/or analysis patterns have been documented 
  in the project-specific guidelines, 
  these should be used as another source of &quot;inspiration&quot; for the analysis 
  classes.</p>

<br>

</div>



<p>A responsibility is a statement of something an object can be asked to

provide. Responsibilities evolve into one (but usually more) operations on

classes in design; they can be characterized as:

<ul>


  <li>The actions that the object can perform.</li>

  <li>The knowledge that the object maintains and provides to other objects.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each analysis class should have several responsibilities; a class with only

one responsibility is probably too simple, while one with a dozen or more is

pushing the limit of reasonability and should potentially be split into several

classes.</p>

<p>That all objects can be created and deleted goes without saying; don’t

restate the obvious unless the object performs some special behavior when it is

created or deleted. (Some objects cannot be removed if certain relationships

exist.)</p>

<h4>Finding Responsibilities</h4>

<p>Responsibilities are derived from messages in interaction diagrams. For

each message, examine the class of the object to which the message is sent. If

the responsibility does not yet exist, create a new responsibility that provides

the requested behavior.</p>

<p>Other responsibilities will derive from non-functional requirements. When you

create a new responsibility, check the non-functional requirements to see if

there are related requirements which apply. Either augment the description of

the responsibility, or create a new responsibility to reflect this.</p>

<h4>Documenting Responsibilities</h4>

<p>Responsibilities are documented with a short (up to several words) name for

the responsibility, and a short (up to several sentences) description. The

description states what the object does to fulfill the responsibility, and what

result is returned when the responsibility is invoked.</p>

<p>In order to carry-out their responsibilities, classes frequently depend on

<h4><a name="Define Attributes">Define Attributes</a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Attributes are used to store information by a class. Specifically, attributes

are used where the information is:

<ul>

  <li>Referred to &quot;by value&quot;; that is, it is only the value of the

    information, not it's location or object identifier which is important.</li>

  <li>Uniquely &quot;owned&quot; by the object to which it belongs; no other

    objects refer to the information.</li>

  <li>Accessed by operations which only get, set or perform simple

    transformations on the information; the information has no &quot;real&quot;

    behavior other than providing its value.</li>

</ul>

<p>If, on the other hand, the information has complex behavior, is shared by two

or more objects, or is passed &quot;by reference&quot; between two or more

objects, the information should be modeled as a separate class.</p>

<p>The attribute name should be a noun that clearly states what information the

attribute holds.</p>

<p>The description of the attribute should describe what information is to be

stored in the attribute; this can be optional when the information stored is

obvious from the attribute name.</p>

<p>The attribute type is the simple data type of the attribute. Examples include

<b>string</b>, <b>integer</b>, <b>number</b>.</p>

<p>Start by studying the links in the interaction diagrams produced in <a href="#Distribute behavior to analysis classes">Distribute

Behavior to Analysis Classes</a>. Links between classes indicate that objects of

the two classes need to communicate with one another to perform the Use Case.

Once we start designing the system, these links may be realized in several ways:

<ul>

  <li>The object may have &quot;global&quot; scope, in which case any object in

    the system can send messages to it</li>

  <li>One object may be passed the second object as a parameter, after which it

    can send messages to the passed object</li>

  <li>The object may have a permanent association to the object to which

    messages are sent.</li>

  <li>The object may be created and destroyed within the scope of the operation

    (i.e. a 'temporary' object) - these objects are considered to be 'local' to

    the operation.</li>

</ul>

<p>At this early point in the &quot;life&quot; of the class, however, it is too

early to start making these decisions: we do not yet have enough information to

make well-educated decisions. As a result, in analysis we create associations

and aggregations to represent (and &quot;carry&quot;) any messages that must be

sent between objects of two classes. (Aggregation, a special form of

association, indicates that the objects participate in a &quot;whole/part&quot;

relationship (see <a href="../modguide/md_assoc.htm">Guidelines: Association</a>

and <a href="../modguide/md_aggrg.htm">Guidelines: Aggregation</a>)).</p>

<p>We will refine these associations and aggregations in the <a href="ac_cldes.htm">Activity:

Class Design</a>.</p>

<p>For each class, draw a class diagram which shows the associations each class

has to other classes:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/aclssdg.gif" alt="an example class diagram, showing associations and aggregations" width="358" height="222"></p>

<p class="picturetext">Example analysis class diagram for part of an Order Entry

System</p>

<p>Focus only on associations needed to realize the use cases; don't add

association you think &quot;might&quot; exist unless they are required based on

the interaction diagrams.</p>

<p>Give the associations role names and multiplicities.

<ul>

  <li>A role name should be a noun expressing what role the associated object

    plays in relation to the associating object.</li>

  <li>Assume a multiplicity of 0..* (zero to many) unless there is some clear

    evidence of something else. A multiplicity of zero implies that the

    association is optional; make sure you mean this; if an object might not be

    there, operations which use the association will have to adjust accordingly.</li>

  <li>Narrower limits for multiplicity may be specified (such as 3..8).</li>

  <li>Within multiplicity ranges, probabilities may be specified. Thus, if the

    multiplicity is 0..*, is expected to be between 10 and 20 in 85% of the

    cases, make note of it; this information will be of great importance during

    design. For example, if persistent storage is to be implemented using a

    relational database, narrower limits will help better organize the database

    tables.</li>

</ul>

<p>Write a brief description of the association to indicate how the association

is used, or what relationships the association represents.</p>

<h4><a name="Describe event dependencies between analysis classes">Describe

Event Dependencies between Analysis Classes </a><a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>

<p>Objects sometimes need to know when an event occurs in some

&quot;target&quot; object, without the &quot;target&quot; having to know all the

objects which require notification when the event occurs. As a short-hand to

show this event-notification dependency, a subscribe-association allows us to

express this dependency in a compact, concise way.</p>

<p>A subscribe-association between two objects indicates that the subscribing

object will be informed when a particular event has occurred in the subscribed

object. A subscribe-association has a <b>condition</b> defining the event that

causes the subscriber to be notified.<b> </b>For more information, see <a href="../modguide/md_sbscr.htm">Guidelines:

Subscribe-Association</a></p>

<p>The conditions of the <b>subscribes-</b>association should be

expressed in terms of abstract characteristics, rather than in terms of its

specific attributes or operations. In this way, the associating object is kept

independent of the contents of the associated entity object, which may well

change.</p>

<p>A subscribe-association is needed:

<ul>

  <li>If an object is influenced by something that occurs in another object.</li>

  <li>If a new object must be created to deal with some event, for example, when

    an error occurs, a new window must be created to notify the user.</li>

  <li>If an object needs to know when another object is instantiated, changed or

    destroyed.</li>

</ul>

<p>The objects which are 'subscribed-to' are typically entity objects. Entity

objects are typically passive stores of information, with any behavior generally

related to their information-storage responsibilities. Many other objects often

need to know when the entity objects change. The subscribe-association prevents

the entity object from having to know about all these other objects - they

simply 'register' interest in the entity object and are notified when the entity

object changes.</p>

<p>Now this is all really just 'analysis sleight-of-hand': in design we have to

define how exactly this notification works. We may purchase a notification

framework, or we may have to design and build one ourselves. But for the moment,

simply noting that the notification exists is sufficient.</p>

<p>The direction of the association shows that only the subscribing object is

aware of the relation between the two objects. The description of the

subscription is entirely within the subscribing object. The associated entity

object, in turn, is defined in the usual way without considering that other

objects might be interested in its activity. This also implies that a

subscribing object can be added to, or removed from, the model without changing

the object to which it subscribes.</p>

The <a href="../artifact/ar_ucrea.htm">use-case realization</a>s were developed

as a result of analyzing a particular use case.&nbsp; Now the individual use-case realizations need to

be reconciled.&nbsp; Examine the <a href="../artifact/ar_aclss.htm">analysis class</a>es

and the supporting associations defined for each of the use-case realizations.&nbsp;

Identify and resolve inconsistencies and remove any duplicates.&nbsp; For

example, two different use-case realizations may include an analysis class that

is conceptually the same, but since the analysis classes were identified by

different <a href="../workers/wk_dsgnr.htm">designer</a>s, a different name was

used.&nbsp;<br>

Note: Duplication across use-case realizations can be significantly reduced if

the <a href="../workers/wk_archt.htm">Software Architect</a> does a

good job defining an initial architecture (see <a href="ac_arcan.htm">Activity:

Architectural Analysis</a>).</p>

<p>When reconciling the model elements, it is important to take into consideration 

  their relationships.&nbsp; If two classes are merged, or one class replaces 

  another, be sure to propagate the original class's relationships to the new 

  class.</p>

<p>The <a href="../workers/wk_archt.htm">Software

Architect</a> should participate in the reconciliation of the use-case

realizations, as it requires an understanding of the business context, as well as some

foresight of the software architecture and design so that the analysis classes

that best represent the problem and solution domains can be selected.</p>

<p>In this step, the analysis mechanisms that apply to each of the identified

analysis classes is examined.</p>



<p>If an analysis class uses one or more analysis mechanisms, additional

information captured now will assist the software architect and designers to determine the

capabilities required of the architectural design mechanisms. The number of

instances of the analysis class, their size, their frequency of access, and

their expected life-span are among the important properties that can assist the

designers in selecting appropriate mechanisms.</p>

<p>For each analysis mechanism used by an analysis class, qualify the relevant

characteristics which need to be considered when selecting appropriate design

and implementation mechanisms. These will vary depending on the type of

mechanism; give ranges where appropriate, or when there is still much

uncertainty. Different architectural mechanisms will have different

characteristics, so this information is purely descriptive and need only be as

structured as necessary to capture and convey the information. During analysis,

this information is generally quite speculative, but capturing has value since

conjectural estimates can be revised as more information is uncovered.</p>

<p>The analysis mechanisms used by a class and their associated characteristic

need not be captured in a formal way; a note attached to a diagram, or an

extension to the description of the class is sufficient to convey the

information. The characteristic information at this point in the evolution of

the class is quite fluid and speculative, so the emphasis is on capturing

expected values rather than on formalizing the definition of the mechanisms.</p>
