<p> The <a href="../artifact/ar_devcs.htm">Artifact: Development Case</a> defines 
  which artifacts to produce and the formality level required for individual artifacts. 
  This serves as an important input to identifying the set of guidelines needed 
  by the project. Preparing guidelines is considered part of tailoring the process 
  for the project, and the process engineer will spend a fair amount of time with 
  the project manager deciding which types of guidelines should be made available 
  to the teams. </p>
<p>Project-specific guidelines serve several purposes, including :</p>
<ul>
  <li>To provide prescriptive and relevant guidance on the production of certain 
    artifacts.</li>
  <li>To ensure that artifacts are developed consistently and follow the defined 
    conventions and styles.</li>
  <li>To describe certain standards required for the project adherence.</li>
  <li>To provide a precursor for staff reviewing the quality and completeness 
    of the artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p> In the table below some of the most commonly considered guidelines for a software 
  project are described. The RUP comes with examples of these that can be used 
  as a starting point for project-specific tailoring. </p>

<h4></h4>
<h4><a name="PrepareObtainExisting">Obtain Existing Guidelines</a> <a href="#PrepareGuidelines"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Step Number 2" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>The Process Engineer, who is responsible for the project-specific processes, 
  continuously looks for useful existing guidelines or examples that can help 
  the project members produce higher quality software more efficiently. Some guidelines 
  may exist in the company's asset repository and are often a compilation of &quot;organization-specific 
  practices.&quot; Others fall into the category of &quot;public standards&quot; 
  and can be found in existing literature or via the Internet. </p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><a name="PrepareDevelopNew">Develop New Guidelines</a> <a href="#PrepareGuidelines"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Step Number 2" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Most guidelines are initially produced as project artifacts, such as the documentation 
  of some micro-process inside a project, and as with most other assets, someone 
  sees the value of the guideline outside the scope of the project and promotes 
  it as a candidate for reuse.</p>
<p>When the decision is made to produce a new guideline inside the project, make 
  sure it gets proper attention and is treated as an internal project deliverable. 
  This includes allocating resources to produce and verify it and including it 
  in the appropriate iteration plans. </p>
<p>In the first instance, developing the guideline for the specific context of 
  the project is highly recommended. There exist numerous stories of projects 
  being derailed because of the focus on generalizing artifacts for future reuse 
  instead of developing them for the specific purpose at hand. As part of the 
  organization's process improvement effort, consider making the produced guidelines 
  reusable for future projects. The work of turning a guideline,or any project 
  artifact, into a reusable asset should ideally be accounted for outside the 
  budget of the single project producing it in the first instance.</p>
<p>New guidelines may be developed anytime during the life cycle of the project. 
  They are commonly developed &quot;just-in-time&quot; or as an activity to document 
  a successful approach to producing other artifacts.</p>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><a name="PrepareTailor">Tailor the Guidelines</a> <a href="#PrepareGuidelines"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Step Number 2" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>Guidelines and examples need to fit the context of the project, or they won't 
  be used. Tailoring the guideline to fit the project is the responsibility of 
  the process engineer and some key representatives from the consumers. It is 
  particularly important to make an effort to tailor guidelines that are harvested 
  from other projects, as they may have been developed for a slightly different 
  context. </p>
<p>You should capture any tailoring decisions made as they may prove useful for 
  future projects wanting to reuse the same guideline. The development case is 
  a good place to document the tailoring decisions made for each of the prepared 
  guidelines.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><a name="PrepareMakeAccessible">Make the Guidelines Accessible</a> <a href="#PrepareGuidelines"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To Step Number 2" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<p>As important as the tailoring is to the guidelines, the accessibility of the 
  prepared guidelines is equally important. It should be clear to the consumers 
  where they should go to find the guidelines or an example and also to whom they 
  should provide feedback on usage. </p>
<p>If you have used the RUP Organizer&#153; to package your company's assets as 
  a RUP Plug-in and chosen to include it in your RUP Configuration published from 
  the RUP Builder&#153;, the guidelines are already a part of the process Website. 
  These are associated with the artifacts and activities they relate to. It is 
  also a good practice to use the development case to list the specific guidelines 
  prepared for this project, including the tailoring decisions made for each of 
  them.</p>

    </tbody> 
  </table>
  <p>In any reuse-focused organization, it is crucial to the process improvement 
    effort that projects provide feedback on their use of assets. Remember that 
    most good practices generally become good because they've been used a number 
    of times before and have had time to be fine-tuned and improved.</p>
  <p>When discovering issues with the guidelines or seeing potential improvements, 
    a project has the option to fix the guideline or raise a change request for 
    it to be handled outside the project. Which option to take often depends on 
    the formality of the process effort in the organization and on the complexity 
    of the issue. The Project Manager should consider defining time slots in every 
    iteration to revise and further develop the guidelines as needed. It is often 
    a good idea to provide an easy-to-use forum for team members to quickly record 
    potential improvements as they are identified.</p>
