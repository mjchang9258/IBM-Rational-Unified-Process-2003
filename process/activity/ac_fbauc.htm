<h3><a name="XE_business_actor__finding"></a><a name="Find Business Actors">Find
Business Actors</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A business actor candidate is any individual, group, organization, company, 
  or machine that interacts with the business such as: 
<ul>
  <li>customers</li>
  <li>partners</li>
  <li>suppliers</li>
  <li>authorities (legal, regulatory, and so forth)</li>
  <li>subsidiaries</li>
  <li>owners and investors (Decide whether the board of directors should be part 
    of the business or modeled as an actor.)</li>
  <li>information systems outside of the business</li>
</ul>
<p>If the business you are going to model is part of a large company, these categories 
  may also contain business actors such as:
<ul>
  <li>other parts of the company</li>
  <li>individual roles within other departments</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important to consider the scope of business modeling and the boundaries 
  of what you are defining as the &quot;target organization.&quot; If you have 
  chosen only a part of the business as the target organization, then the other 
  parts of the same company also will be business actors.</p>
<p>Name each business actor in such a way that its name denotes its role in the 
  business. Define each business actor by writing a brief description that takes 
  into account its responsibility and why it interacts with the business, including 
  the types of added value that the business actor wants from the business. See 
  <a href="../modguide/md_bact.htm">Guidelines: Business Actor</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_use_case__finding"></a><a name="Find Business Use Cases">Find
Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To find the primary business use cases, consider what value each business actor 
  receives from the business. Ask yourself what services the business actor expects 
  to receive from the business. It might help to start with the core business 
  use cases—those that serve the customer or the equivalent of the customer in 
  cases in which there is no commercial interaction. For more information on categories 
  of business use cases, see <a href="../modguide/md_bucm.htm">Guidelines: Business 
  Use-Case Model</a>. 
<p>It is helpful to study the business actor's lifecycle to determine the answers 
  to questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What was the business actor's first
contact with the business?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What stages or states does the business actor go through in relation to the business?</li>
  <li>What does the business actor regard as a meaningful interaction with the
    business?</li>
  <li>When is the business actor satisfied?</li>
  <li>What events does the business actor expect to be notified of?</li>
</ul>
<p>From a perspective of supporting the business, processes can also be represented 
  as business use cases. Ask yourself what is required in order to deliver products 
  and services to customers. Of course, the scope of business modeling and the 
  defined business modeling objectives will determine the granularity of supporting 
  business use cases, if you are going to consider them at all. Look for the following 
  kinds of processes: 
<ul>
  <li>development and maintenance of the staff</li>
  <li>development and maintenance of the IT within the business</li>
  <li>development and maintenance of the office and facilities</li>
  <li>security</li>
  <li>legal advice</li>
  <li>partner and contract management</li>
  <li>accounting</li>
  <li>logistics</li>
  <li>purchasing</li>
  <li>marketing analysis and research</li>
  <li>product development</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of managing the business, processes can be represented 
  as business use cases, although they are seldom as interesting from an information-system 
  aspect. To identify management processes, look for activities associated with 
  managing the business as a whole, as well as ones that normally interact with 
  the owner actors. Consider what the owner actors receive from the business. 
  Search for activities that: 
<ul>
  <li>Develop and provide information about the business to owners and investors.</li>
  <li>Set up long-term goals.</li>
  <li>Coordinate and prioritize between the other business use cases in the business.</li>
  <li>Create new processes in the business.</li>
  <li>Plan and execute improvements.</li>
  <li>Monitor the processes in the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lifecycle of a process of this kind often spans one fiscal year.</p>
<p>Another way to identify business use cases is to have domain experts describe 
  every activity in the existing business. These activities are then grouped into 
  business use cases, which are named and briefly described. </p>
<p>You also must consider any defined business goals. Investigating these business 
  goals sometimes discloses a business use case that otherwise would have remained 
  undiscovered.</p>
<p>See <a href="../modguide/md_bucm.htm">Guidelines: Business Use-Case
Model</a> and <a href="../modguide/md_buc.htm">Guidelines: Business Use Case</a>
for additional information.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_actor__finding"></a><a name="Consider Business Goals">Consider
Business Goals<img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Review any business goals that have already been described, and consider whether 
  they will be supported by business use cases. If you discover that a business 
  use case supports two completely different goals, you might consider splitting 
  it into two. If a business use case supports very different business goals, 
  you will find it difficult to measure or improve its performance. Business use 
  cases that support none of the already-identified business goals may be unnecessary. 
  Further investigation of these business use cases, on the other hand, may reveal 
  undiscovered business goals.</p>
<p>Business goals must also be considered in comparison to the business actors. 
  Do the identified business goals drive the business toward the business actors 
  that they intend to embrace? Are any business actors not addressed by the business 
  goals? New business goals also might be discovered during this analysis. See 
  <a href="../modguide/md_bgoal.htm">Guidelines: Business Goals</a> for more information.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_use_case__prioritizing"></a><a name="Prioritize Business Use Cases">Prioritize
Business Use Cases</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Once you have identified the business actors and business use cases, you must 
  prioritize those business use cases that are of high interest and therefore 
  must be described in detail. (See <a href="ac_debuc.htm">Activity: Detail a 
  Business Use Case</a>.) To determine high-priority business use cases: 
<ul>
  <li>Determine the business use cases that will be of interest to the intended 
    system if you perform business engineering to find the requirements of information 
    systems. </li>
  <li>Develop a step-by-step description before deciding whether or not to include 
    any business use cases that are not clearly relevant from an information-system 
    perspective.</li>
  <li>Look for the business use cases that support the most important business 
    goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <a href="../modguide/md_bad.htm">Guidelines: Business Architecture
Document</a> for more criteria for identifying architecturally significant
business use cases.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_use_case__outlining"></a><a name="Develop an Outline to the Workflow of Business Use Case">Develop
an Outline of the Workflow of Business Use Case</a>s <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>To understand the purpose of a business use case, you often need a step-by-step 
  outline of the workflow. The person who will later specify the business use 
  case also will require this step-by-step description.</p>
<p>For example, the first draft of a step-by-step workflow description of the 
  business use case &quot;Individual Check-In&quot; might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Passenger enters the queue to check-in counter.</li>
    <li>Passenger gives ticket to check-in agent.</li>
    <li>Check-in agent validates ticket.</li>
    <li>Check-in agent registers baggage.</li>
    <li>Check-in agent reserves seat for passenger.</li>
    <li>Boarding card is printed.</li>
    <li>Check-in agent gives passenger boarding card.</li>
    <li>Passenger leaves check-in counter.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<font size="3">
<p class="example">Note that this is a first draft, so it may lack activities 
  that will be discovered later. You may also include alternative flows in this 
  initial set of steps. </p>
<p class="example">The first draft provides a clear picture of what the business 
  use case does, when it starts, when it stops, and what value it provides. You 
  normally will not need more than an hour to define a rough step-by-step outline 
  for a business use case. (Exceptions are outlines for supporting and management 
  business use cases&#151they are not usually clear-cut.)</p>
<p>Concentrate on the most important business use cases&#151that is, those that 
  represent the highest improvement potential. Can the business use case's scope 
  be increased so that work originally done by the customer, or by no one, will 
  now be done by the target organization? Can the scope be diminished so that 
  the customer will now work on tasks previously done by the target organization? 
  A business use case is improved if it serves the customer better, which implies 
  that it becomes simpler, produces better products, offers shorter lead times, 
  and so on. &quot;Customers should be able to penetrate right to the heart of 
  the business&quot; [<a href="../referenc.htm#SEY98">SEY98</a>].</p>
<p>For each business use case, set measurable goals that can be used to verify 
  whether or not you have succeeded. These business goals can later be refined 
  and translated into other business goals, as well as into the business strategy. 
  When the new target organization is established, business goals can be used 
  to continuously measure how the business use cases are functioning and being 
  improved.&nbsp;</p>

Use Case</a>.</font></p>
<h3><a name="Describe How Business Actors and Use Cases Interact">Describe How
Business Actors and Use Cases Interact</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Establish those business actors that interact with the business use case by 
  defining a communicates-association between them. If it is important to show 
  who initiated the communication, you can add navigability to the association. 
  If it improves the readability of the model, you can also name the association.</p>
<p>See <a href="../modguide/md_bcomm.htm">Guidelines:
Communicates-Association in the Business Use-Case Model</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Package Business Use Cases and Actors">Package Business Use Cases
and Actors</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>If you have many business use cases, you can divide them into packages to make 
  the documentation easier to understand. For example, business actors can be 
  packaged according to type such as Market, Regulatory Bodies, and Partners. 
  Business use cases can be grouped according to purpose, such as Sales and Marketing, 
  Product Development, and Management. Alternatively, they can be grouped according 
  to business actor such as Shareholders and Investors or Direct Customers.</p>
<h3><a name="XE_business_use-case_model__presenting_in_diagrams"></a><a name="Present the Business Use-Case Model in Use-Case Diagrams">Present
the Business Use-Case Model in Use-Case Diagrams</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>Use-case diagrams illustrate the combination of business actors, business use
cases, and their relationships. A diagram may contain any of the following:
<ul>
  <li>all the business actors within a package</li>
  <li>a business actor and all other business actors that specialize in the first 
    one </li>
  <li>a business actor and all the business use cases with which it interacts</li>
  <li>business use cases that interact with the same business actors</li>
  <li>business use cases that are usually performed in a sequence</li>
  <li>business use cases that belong to the same use-case package</li>
  <li>the most important business use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the diagram of the most important business use cases can function 
  as a summary of the complete Business Use-Case Model and thus prove helpful 
  in reviewing it. See <a href="../modguide/md_bucdg.htm">Guidelines: Use-Case 
  Diagram in the Business Use-Case Model</a>.</p>

<p>The Survey Description (<a href="../reports/re_bucm.htm">Report: Business Use-Case 
  Model Survey</a>) of the Business Use-Case Model needs to convey the following 
  information: 
<ul>
  <li>the purpose of the business being described</li>

<p>At this state, be sure to check the Business Use-Case Model to verify that 
  your work is on track. Do not, however, review the model in detail. You must 
  also consider the checkpoints for the Business Use-Case Model while you are 
  working on it. The interested parties must determine if: 
<ul>
  <li> All necessary business use cases are identified.</li>
  <li> Any unnecessary business use cases are identified.</li>
  <li> The behavior of each business use case is described in the right order.</li>
  <li>Each business use case's workflow is as complete as possible at this stage.</li>
  <li> The Survey Description of the Business Use-Case Model makes it understandable.</li>
