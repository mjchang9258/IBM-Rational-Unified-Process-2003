<p><font face="Helvetica-Bold">Overall, the system is soundly based
architecturally,
because:</font>
<ul>
  <li class="ck">The architecture appears to be stable.
    <p>The need for stability is dictated by the nature of the Construction
    phase: in Construction the project typically expands, adding developers who
    will work in parallel, communicating loosely with other developers as they
    produce the product. The degree of independence and parallelism needed in
    Construction simply cannot be achieved if the architecture is not stable.</p>
    <p>The importance of a stable architecture cannot be overstated. Do not be
    deceived into thinking that 'pretty close is good enough' - unstable is
    unstable, and it is better to get the architecture right and delay the onset
    of Construction rather than proceed. The coordination problems involved in
    trying to repair the architecture while developers are trying to build upon
    its foundation will easily erase any apparent benefits of accelerating the
    schedule. Changes to architecture during Construction have broad impact:
    they tend to be expensive, disruptive and demoralizing.</p>
    <p>The real difficulty of assessing architectural stability is that
    &quot;you don't know what you don't know&quot;; stability is measured
    relative to expected change. As a result, stability is essentially a
    subjective measure. We can, however, base this subjectivity on more than
    just conjecture. The architecture itself is developed by considering
    'architecturally significant' scenarios - sub-sets of use cases which
    represent the most technologically challenging behavior the system must
    support. Assessing the stability of the architecture involves ensuring that
    the architecture has broad coverage, to ensure that there will be no
    'surprises' in the architecture going forward.</p>
    <p>Past experience with the architecture can also be a good indicator: if
    the rate of change in the architecture is low, and remains low as new
    scenarios are covered, there is good reason to believe that the architecture
    is stabilizing. Conversely, if each new scenario causes changes in the
    architecture, it is still evolving and baselining is not yet warranted.</p>

  <li class="ck">The complexity of the system matches the functionality it provides.</li>
  <li class="ck"> The conceptual complexity is appropriate given the skill and 
    experience of its:

    <li class="ck">users</li>
    <li class="ck">operators</li>
    <li class="ck">developers</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="ck">The system has a single consistent, coherent architecture</li>
  <li class="ck">The number and types of component is reasonable</li>

    event of a failure within the required amount of time.</li>
  <li class="ck">The products and techniques on which the system is based match
    its expected life?
    <ul>
      <li class="ck">An interim (tactical) system with a short life can safely
        be built using old technology because it will soon be discarded.</li>
      <li class="ck">A system with a long life expectancy (most systems) should
        be built on up-to-date technology and methods so it can be maintained
        and expanded to support future requirements.</li>

  <li class="ck">The architecture provides defines clear interfaces to enable
    partitioning for parallel team development.</li>

    architecture to successfully design and develop the model element.</li>
  <li class="ck">The packaging approach reduces complexity and improves
    understanding.</li>
  <li class="ck">Packages have been defined to be highly cohesive within the
    package, while the packages themselves are loosely coupled.</li>
  <li class="ck">Similar solutions within the common application domain have
    been considered.</li>
  <li class="ck">The proposed solution can be easily understood by someone
    generally knowledgeable in the problem domain.</li>

    as the one presented by the software architect.</li>
  <li class="ck">The Software Architecture Document is current.</li>
  <li class="ck">The Design Guidelines have been followed.</li>
  <li class="ck">All technical risks been either mitigated or have been
    addressed in a contingency plan. New risk discovered have been documented
    and analyzed for their potential impact.</li>

    been satisfied.</li>
  <li class="ck">Test cases, test harnesses, and test configurations have been

<h4><a name="General Model Considerations">General Model Considerations</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../../images/top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h4>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li class="ck">The model is at an appropriate level of detail given the
      model objectives.</li>
    <li class="ck">For the business model, requirements model or the design
      model during the elaboration phase, there is not an over-emphasis on
      implementation issues.</li>
    <li class="ck">For the design model in the construction phase, there is a
      good balance of functionality across the model elements, using composition
      of relatively simple elements to build a more complex design.</li>
    <li class="ck">The model demonstrates familiarity and competence with the
      full breadth of modeling concepts applicable to the problem domain;
      modeling techniques are used appropriately for the problem at hand.</li>
    <li class="ck">Concepts are modeled in the simplest way possible.</li>
    <li class="ck">The model is easily evolved; expected changes can be easily
      accommodated.</li>
    <li class="ck">At the same time, the model has not been overly structured to
      handle unlikely change, at the expense of simplicity and
      comprehensibility.</li>
    <li class="ck">The key assumptions behind the model are documented and
      visible to reviewers of the model. If the assumptions are applicable to a
      given iteration, then the model should be able to be evolved within those
      assumptions, but not necessarily outside of those assumptions. Documenting
      assumptions is a way of indemnifying designers from not looking at
      &quot;all&quot; possible requirements. In an iterative process, it is
      impossible to analyze all possible requirements, and to define a model
      which will handle every future requirement.</li>
