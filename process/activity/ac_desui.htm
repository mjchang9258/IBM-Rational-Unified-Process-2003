<p>When designing the user-interface, keep in mind any <a href="../artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboards</a> created during requirements elicitation, 
the user interface guidelines in the project-specific guidelines, as well as any existing <a href="../artifact/ar_uiprt.htm">User-Interface Prototypes</a>. 
If it is discovered that refinements to the Storyboards are needed as a result of this activity, these updates are performed by the 
<a href="../workers/wk_sysan.htm">System Analyst</a> (see <a href="../activity/ac_elstk.htm">activity: Elicit Stakeholder Requests</a>).</p>

<p>Describe the characteristics of the (human) users that will interact with the 
  system to perform the requirements being considered in the current iteration. 
  Focus on describing the primary users since the major part of the interactions 
  involve these users. This information is important for the subsequent steps 
  below.</p>

<p>Collaborate with the System Analyst to determine if any changes to the <a href="../artifact/ar_actor.htm">Actor</a> 
  description is needed to reflect the characteristic descriptions. Refer to <a href="../modguide/md_actor.htm#Actor Characteristics">Guidelines: 
  Actor, Characteristics</a> for details.</p>


<h3><a name="Identify_the_Primary_User_Interface_Elements"></a>Identify the Primary User-Interface 

  Elements <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Looking at the requirements being considered in the current iteration (especially 
  any <a href="../artifact/ar_uc.htm">Use Cases</a>  
  and/or <a href="../artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboards</a>), identify 
  the primary windows of the system's user interface. By &quot;primary&quot; we 
  mean those windows that the user will interact with the most (those user-interface 
  elements that are central to the user's mental model of the system). Primary 
  windows contain menus and may contain sub-windows or forms. Primary windows 
  are the windows the user navigates between. Non-primary windows may end up as 
  part of a primary window.</p>

  

<p>The main primary window should be the window that is opened when the user launches 

  the application. It is normally always open as long as the application is running, 

  and is the place where the user spends a considerable part of his &quot;use 

  time.&quot; Since it is always open and since it constitutes the user's first 

  contact with the system, it is the foremost vehicle for enforcing the user's 

  mental model of the system. The main primary window is commonly referred to 

  as the &quot;home page&quot;.</p>

<p>Attempt to group user-interface elements together into the same primary window 

  if they need to be shown together or in spatial relation to other user-interface 

  elements. However, this is not always possible due to limitations in screen 

  area. Note that the average object volumes is an important input to this step, 

  since they state how many objects that potentially need to be shown at once. 

  Too many objects may imply that they cannot all appear on the same window; instead, 

  a primary wondow may contain a compact representation of the objects and then 

  separate primary windows may be defined for each of the objects (or a set of 

  objects).</p>

<p>The following are some recommendations for primary windows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Windows that are central to the user's mental model of the system.</li>

  <li>Windows that the user will spend most use time in.</li>

  <li>Windows that provide the initiation of use cases.</li>

</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that the goal is to minimize the number of primary windows and 

  the number of navigation paths between them. </p>





<h3><a name="Define_the_Navigation_Map"></a>Define the Navigation Map <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>Based on the identified set of primary windows, and the <a href="../artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboards</a>, 
define the system's <a href="../artifact/ar_navmap.htm">Navigation Map</a>. </p>

<p>The Navigation Map should include the primary user-interface elements and their 

  navigation paths. It does not need to contain all of the possible paths through 

  the user-interface elements, just the main pathways. The goal is for the Navigation 

  Map to serve as a road map of the system’s user interface.</p>

<p>An most obvious candidate for &quot;top&quot; user-interface element in the 

  Navigation Map is the main primary window (the window where the user spends 

  the majority of his/her use time).</p>

<p>The Navigation Map should make it clear "how many clicks" a user needs to make 

  to get to a specific screen or piece of functionality. Generally, you want to 

  have the most important areas of the application only &quot;one click away&quot; 

  from the primary window. In addition to adding needless interaction overhead, 

  window navigation paths that are too long make it more likely that the user 

  will &quot;get lost&quot; in the system. Ideally, all windows should be opened 

  from a main primary window, resulting in a maximum window navigation length 

  of two. Try to avoid window navigation lengths greater than three.</p>

<p>The Navigation Map should also adhere to and reflect the usage metaphor for 

  the system's user interface, as documented in the project-specific guidelines.</p>

<p>A variety of representations may be used for the Navigation Map. Some examples 

  include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A hierarchical &quot;tree&quot; diagram, where each level of the diagram 

    shows the number of clicks it takes to get to a specific user-interface element</li>

  <li>Free-form graphics with custom icons.</li>

  <li>UML class diagram where classes are used for user interface elements and 

    associations are used for navigation paths.</li>

</ul>

<p>The selection of which representation to use is specified in the project-specific 

  guidelines.</p>



<h3><a name="Detail_the_Design_of_the_User_Interface_Elements"></a>Detail the Design of the 

  User-Interface Elements <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>

<p>At this point, the high-level user-interface design is complete:

<ul>

  <li>The primary windows have been identified</li>

  <li>The user-interface elements and their navigation paths have been defined 

        (the <a href="../artifact/ar_navmap.htm">Navigation Map</a>)</li>

      

</ul>

<p>The detailed design of the user-interface elements can now be performed. The 

  following are different aspects of designing the user-interface elements. Each 

  of these are described below: 

<ul>

  <li><a href="#Design the Visualization of the Primary Windows">Design the Visualization 

    of the Primary Windows</a></li>

  <li><a href="#Design the User Actions of the Primary Windows">Design the User 

    Actions of the Primary Windows</a></li>

  <li><a href="#Design Miscellaneous Features">Design Miscellaneous Features</a></li>

</ul>





<h4><a name="Design the Visualization of the Primary Windows"></a>Design the Visualization of the Primary Windows</h4>

<p>The visualization of the primary windows, and the main primary window in particular, 

  will have a significant impact on the usability of the system. Designing this 

  visualization is about determining which parts (properties) of the contained 

  user-interface elements should be visualized. 

 The <a href="../artifact/ar_storyboard.htm">Storyboard</a> 

  flows of events can be used to help prioritize which properties to show. 

 If the user needs 

  to see many different properties of the user-interface elements, you may implement 

  several views of a primary window, each view visualizing a different set of 

  properties. Designing this visualization also means that you have to look at 

  how the properties of the contained user-interface elements should be visualized, 

  by using all visual dimensions. For details, refer to section &quot;Visual Dimensions&quot; 

  in <a href="../modguide/md_uig.htm">Guidelines: User Interface (General)</a>.</p>

<p>Where possible, attempt to identify &quot;common denominators&quot; across 

  the elements to be displayed in the primary windows. By visualizing common denominators 

  in some dimension, the user can relate the elements with each other and start 

  to see patterns. This greatly increases the &quot;bandwidth&quot; of the user 

  interface.</p>

<h5></h5>

<h5>Example:</h5>

<p>Assume you have a customer service system, where you want to 

  show aspects like: 

<ul>

  <li>The customer's complaints and questions over time.</li>

  <li>What products the customer has purchased over time.</li>

  <li>How much the customer has been invoiced over time.</li>

</ul>

<p>Here, a common denominator is &quot;time.&quot; Thus, displaying complaints/questions, 

  purchases and invoices beside each other on the same horizontal time axis will 

  enable the user to see patterns of how these are related (if they are).</p>

  

<h4><a name="Design the User Actions of the Primary Windows"></a>Design the User Actions of the Primary Windows</h4>

<p>This is where you decide how to &quot;implement&quot; the user actions that 

  can be invoked for the primary windows. It is common that the user actions of 

  the primary windows are provided as menu items in a menu bar, and are provided 

  as an alternative and complement via shortcut menus and toolbars. </p>

<p>For each primary window, define the menu(s) and menu options. For example, 

  in a document editor, there is an Edit menu, grouping cohesive operations such 

  as Cut, Copy, etc.</p>

<p>Some user actions may require a complex interaction with the user, thereby 

  justifying a secondary window of their own. For example, in a document editor, 

  there is a Print operation on a Document that, due to its complex interaction, 

  justifies a separate dialog window.</p>

<p>If a large number of objects are to be visualized in a window, it may be necessary 

  to design user actions involving these objects. The following are some examples 

  of such user actions: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Searching among multiple objects.</li>

  <li>Sorting multiple objects.</li>

  <li>Browsing hierarchies of multiple objects.</li>

  <li>Selecting multiple objects.</li>

</ul>

<p>Refer to <a href="../modguide/md_uig.htm">Guidelines: User Interface (General)</a> 

  for more detail.</p>



<h4><a name="Design Miscellaneous Features"></a>Design Miscellaneous Features</h4>

<p>Add the necessary dynamic behavior to the user interface. Most dynamics are 

  given by the target platform, like the select-operate paradigm, open by double-clicking, 

  pop-up menus on right mouse button, etc. There are, however, some decisions 

  you need to make, including: 

<ul>

  <li>How to support window management.</li>

  <li>What session information, like input cursor position, scroll bar position, 

    opened windows, window sizes, relative window positions, etc., to store between 

    sessions.</li>

  <li>Whether to support single or multiple document interfaces (SDI or MDI) for 

    your primary windows.</li>

</ul>

<p>Also evaluate other common features that can enhance usability, including: 

<ul>

  <li>Whether &quot;on-line help,&quot; including &quot;wizards,&quot; should 

    be provided.</li>

  <li>Whether an &quot;undo&quot; operation should be provided, to make the system 

    safe for exploration.</li>

  <li>Whether &quot;agents&quot; should be provided, to monitor user events and 

    actively suggest actions.</li>

  <li>Whether &quot;dynamic highlighting&quot; should be provided, to visualize 

    associations.</li>

  <li>Whether user-defined &quot;macros&quot; should be supported.</li>

  <li>Whether there are specific areas that should be user configurable.</li>

</ul>

<p>Refer to <a href="../modguide/md_uig.htm">Guidelines: User Interface (General)</a> 

  for more detail.</p>
