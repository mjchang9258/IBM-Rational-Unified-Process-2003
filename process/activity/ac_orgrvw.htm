<p>The person filling the <a href="../workers/wk_rvwmng.htm">Review Coordinator</a> role starts this activity 
  when the current project work plans have been consulted and the need for a review 
  identifed.</p>
<p>The artifacts mentioned in the &quot;Input Artifacts&quot; section 
  define a review framework, providing guidance and directions with regards to 
  what the overall scope of the reviews should be, when they should take place, 
  what is the level of formalism, and so forth. More detailed guidance could be 
  found in the the Measurement Plan, the Quality Assurance Plan, the Development 
  Case and in the Project Specific Guidelines.</p>
<p>There are various approaches to planning review activities: these approaches 
  vary based on factors such as team size, team culture, the required formality 
  of the projects process and the current point in the project lifecycle. Some 
  of the general techniques used include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inspection</b>. A formal evaluation technique in which one or more artifacts 
    are examined in detail. Inspections are considered to be the most productive 
    review technique, however it requires training, and preparation to perform 
    them well.</li>
  <li><b>Walkthrough</b>. An evaluation technique where the author of one or more 
    artifacts, &quot;walks&quot; one or more reviewers through the artifact. The 
    reviewers ask questions, and make comments regarding technique, style, possible 
    omissions or errors, deviation from established standards, and so on.</li>
  <li><b>Pre-reading & Feedback</b>. One or more reviewers read through the artifact 
    independently and make notes about their observations. When the reviewers 
    are ready, they can meet and present their comments and questions. The meeting 
    can be omitted, however, and reviewers can give their comments and questions 
    to the author in written form instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximize efficiency and minimize team interruptions, consider planning 
  the reviews in such a way that the required reviewers can be conviened a miminum 
  number of times by having them review as many artifacts as possible. Obviously 
  a realistic workload needs to be maintained for each review, so you will need 
  to balance these conflicting needs accordingly.</p>

</div>
<p>It is important to provide attendee's with sufficient notice about the review, 
  and to advise them about what will be expectated of them in terms of both preparatory 
  work and their involvement in the review process itself. Make it clear to each 
  attendee what stakeholding they are being asked to represent and as such the 
  type of review critique and feedback you are expecting from them.</p>
<p>Consult each of the specific review activities and accompanying guidelines 
  in RUP to determine the criteria for inviting attendees, the recommended prepartory 
  work for an attendeee and the expectations that will be placed on them by agreeing 
  to attend the review. As some general guidance, you should consider the following 
  stakeholders when inviting attendees to participate in the review meetings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The subsequent direct consumers of the artifact, including testing and documentation 
    staff.</li>
  <li>Peers playing the role as the producer of the artifact who will act as domain 
    or subject-matter experts.</li>
  <li>The producer of the artifact.</li>
  <li>The sponsor or budget holder.</li>
  <li>The consumer or users of the final product that will be realized from this 
    artifact.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to find the right balance between including the desired review 
  participants and keeping the review manageable and productive. Care should be 
  taken to include only those participants who will contribute to achieving the 
  objectives of the review. In general, it is usually more productive to hold 
  several focused review sessions with a smaller number of participants, than 
  to hold one review involving many.</p>

  attendee what stakeholding they are being asked to represent and as such the 
  type of review critique and feedback you are expecting from them.</p>

<p>While each of the specific review activities and accompanying guidelines in 
  RUP provides specific guidelines and suggestions about how to conduct each review, 
  the following guidelines are generally helpful when conducting any review: 
<ul>
  <li>Always set aside specific time to conduct the review, usually in a recognized 
    and repeatable meeting format, even if the meeting itself is casual or informal.</li>
  <li>To improve productivity, have the meeting participants prepare their own 
    detailed reviews feedback on their own prior to the meeting.</li>
  <li>Check: 
    <ul>
      <li> the quality of what has been produced to make sure the work meets an 
        appropraite and acceptable standard of workmanship.</li>
      <li> the completeness of what has been produced to make sure the work is 
        sufficient for the subsequent work it will be referenced or consumed in. 
        In many cases, Checkpoints are provided to help with this task; refer 
        to the checkpoints for each Artifact or its associated activities.</li>
    </ul>
    Note: you should consider using these checkpoints in your daily work on each 
    artiafct: this will potentially save you time and effort in downstream rework. 
    Note also that these checkpoints are useful for informal as well as formal 
    review meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following each review meeting, the results of the meeting should be documented 
  in some form of <a href="../artifact/ar_rvrec.htm">Review Record</a>. In addition, 
  change request may be formal;ly recorded (and eventually assigned to someone 
  to own and drive to resolution).</p>

<p>Once of the most important yet surprisingly often neglected aspects of reviews 
  is the management to resolution of the follow-up tasks or actions identified 
  during the review. While you can usually assign many of the identified actions 
  during the course of the review meeting itself, be prepared to reassign tasks 
  as needed to help balance the workload of team members.</p>

<p>Note that even if you can review everything you need to in a single meeting, 
  you probably won't get approval of all your conclusions the first time. Be prepared 
  to carry out subsequent reviews as necessary to help manage the undertaking 
  of a large number of follow-up tasks.</p>
