<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>When the process and tools have been tailored you need to train the members
of the project on what the development case is, what can be found in the
guidelines, the templates, and how to use the new tools.</p>
<p>The purpose of a &quot;kick-start&quot; workshop of this kind is to get
people in the project up-to-speed using the new process and new tools as quickly
as possible. The workshop does not replace standard training courses.&nbsp;It
should be an efficient way to get the members of the project up-to-speed on any
new part of their development environment. You should work on material that can
be perceived as &quot;real&quot; project material, and follow the new parts of
the development case, together with the new templates, guidelines and tools. The
main purpose is to get hands-on experience of using the new sections of the
development case together with templates, guidelines and tools. The workshop is
also a way to verify the development case, templates, guidelines and
tools.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Who Should Attend">Who Should Attend</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A <a href="../workers/wk_prcen.htm">process engineer</a> together with a <a href="../workers/wk_tlsmt.htm">tool
specialist</a> should prepare and facilitate the workshop. It is essential that
they are people with in-depth knowledge of the process and the relevant
tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All people in the project that are going to work according to the development
case and use the tools, should attend. To be efficient, the workshop should
require that the participants have knowledge in process and tools, equivalent to
what is taught in standard training courses.&nbsp;If the project team is large,
divide up in smaller teams of 10-15 people each and conduct the workshop with
each team. Otherwise, there is a value in bringing all members of the project
together to walk through the process and the tools in order to make sure you all
have a similar understanding and perception of the development
environment.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Before the Workshop">Before the Workshop</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>A workshop of this kind does not replace any standard training courses on
process and tools, rather, those kind of courses are a pre-requisite for this
workshop. But, one of the first things you should put in place is what your
audience will look like so that you know what basic knowledge you can assume
from the participants of the workshop. Try to understand what level of
experience they have, both of the technology to be applied as well as of the
problem domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establish the objectives of the workshop. Typically, they would be:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary objective of the workshop is to get the participants
    up-to-speed on the new process and tools.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The secondary objective is to get feedback on the new process and tools.
    The participants are expected to provide feedback for improvements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you may have objective such as letting the members of you team
meet for the first time and establish how they will work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determine the duration of the workshop. Unless there are very specific needs,
you should try to limit the duration to one day. Remember that standard training
courses should be a pre-requisite, and the focus is on understanding specifics
of your development environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a facilitator you need to prepare materials for the workshop. As this is
an event that may not be conducted more than a few times, you need to make sure
you don't 'over invest' in materials. The materials you use should mainly be
materials or artifacts that you develop anyway for the project.&nbsp;The only
additional materials would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An agenda for the workshop, based on the process you will follow.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>An example to work with during the workshop. This can preferably be an
    example from your environment, maybe even a small part of the application
    that will be a result of the project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of logistics, you need to make sure the following is
available:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A conference room where you can tape the walls with the results of your
    work.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Computers, set up so that you can use your development environment.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The tools that will be used by the development team, including the
    Rational Unified Process (RUP).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Development Case itself, and your version of the project web
    site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The guidelines artifacts you have developed for the project.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Any templates you have decided to use&#151either the standard templates
    provided in the RUP or your version of them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to set the right expectations on the workshop. The stakeholders
of the class - its participants as well as any of the managers who decide to
invest in the workshop - should be aware that:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The workshop is <b>not </b>a standard training course. There will not be
    professional quality training materials, nor will there be well-prepared
    teachers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There will be some agenda, but it will probably change during the course
    of the workshop.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The workshop does <b>not </b>replace standard training courses.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The participants must have good knowledge about the process and tools,
    equivalent to the relevant standard training courses.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The students are expected to be pro-active, the workshop facilitators
    should not have to lead them each and every step of the way. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Conduct the Workshop">Conduct the Workshop</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>The facilitator conducts the workshop, which includes:
<ul>
  <li>Giving everyone an opportunity to speak.
  <li>Keeping the session on track. There is a great tendency for these kind of
    workshops to turn into philosophical elaborations on the general problems of
    developing software.&nbsp;
  <li>Gathering input on the development case presented. Make sure you record
    any problems discovered, but do not dwell on them if you don't have the
    right competencies represented to solve them.
  <li>Gather input on the format and delivery of the development case
    workshop.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Summarizing the session and working out conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Concluding the Workshop">Concluding the Workshop</a> <a href="#Top"><img src="../../images/top.gif" alt="To top of page" border="0" width="26" height="20"></a></h3>
<p>After the development case workshop, the facilitator, along with fellow
process engineers, needs to spend time to analyze any inputs participants gave
on the development case as well as the workshop format.&nbsp;
