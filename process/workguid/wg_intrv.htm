<h2 class="banner"><a name="Top"></a>Guidelines:&nbsp;<rpw name="PresentationName">Interviews</rpw></h2>
<p>An effective, direct person-to-person interviewing technique requires that 
  you have prepared a list of questions designed to gain an understanding of the 
  real problems and potential solutions. To get as unbiased answers as possible, 
  you need to make sure the questions you ask are context-free. The context-free 
  question is a high-level, abstract question that can be posed early in a project 
  to obtain information about global properties of the user's problem and potential 
  solutions.</p>
<p>A context-free question is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always appropriate.</li>
  <li>Formulated so that it helps you understand stakeholder perspectives.</li>
  <li>Not biased with solutions knowledge or your opinion of what the solution
    should be.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../webtmpl/templates/req/rup_stkreq.htm#1.     Introduction">Context-Free 
  Interview Script</a>:&nbsp;Great opportunities exist in our industry to improve 
  application development efforts. Understanding stakeholder or user needs before 
  beginning development is crucial to improving this process. Many techniques 
  are available to elicit stakeholder or user needs. One simple and inexpensive 
  technique that is appropriate for use in virtually every situation is the Generic 
  Interview. The Generic Interview can help the developer or analyst understand 
  stakeholder or user objectives and problems. Armed with this insight, developers 
  can create applications that fit the stakeholder or user's real needs and increase 
  their satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Generic Interview in the supplied template for <a href="../artifact/ar_stnds.htm">Artifact: 
  Stakeholder Requests</a> features questions designed to elicit an understanding 
  of the stakeholder's or user's problems and environment. These questions explore 
  the functionality, usability, reliability, performance and supportability requirements 
  for the application. As a result of using the Generic Interview, the developer 
  or analyst will gain knowledge of the problem being solved, as well as an understanding 
  of the stakeholder or user's insights on the characteristics of successful solutions.</p>
<p><b>Guidelines for Use:</b> If the Generic Interview is not suited to your needs, 
  feel free to modify it. With a little preparation and a well-structured interview, 
  any developer or analyst can interview effectively. Here are some hints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research the background of the stakeholder or user and the company ahead 
    of time.</li>
  <li>Review the questions prior to the interview.</li>
  <li>Refer to the format during the interview to ensure the right questions are 
    being asked.</li>
  <li>Summarize the top two or three problems at the end of the interview. </li>
  <li>Repeat what you learned to confirm your comprehension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not let the script become overly constraining. Once rapport is established, 
  the interview often takes on a life of its own, and the stakeholder or user 
  may talk at length about the difficulties they're experiencing. Do not stop 
  the stakeholder or user. Record these responses as quickly as possible. Follow 
  up on the information with questions. Once this exchange reaches its logical 
  end, proceed with other questions on the list.</p>
<p>Examples of context-free questions used to find actors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who is the customer?</li>
  <li>Who is the user?</li>
  <li>Are their needs different?</li>
  <li>What are their backgrounds, capabilities, environments?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of context-free questions that help you understand business processes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem?</li>
  <li>What is the reason for wanting to solve this problem?</li>
  <li>Are there other reasons for wanting to solve this problem?</li>
  <li>What is the value of a successful solution?</li>
  <li>How do you solve the problem now?</li>
  <li>What is the trade-off between time and value?</li>
  <li>Where else can the solution to this problem be found?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of context-free questions that help you understand requirements on 
  the system or product to be built:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What problem does this product solve?</li>
  <li>What business problems could this product create?</li>
  <li>What hazards could exist for the user?</li>
  <li>What environment will the product encounter?</li>
  <li>What are your expectations for usability?</li>
  <li>What are your expectations for reliability?</li>
  <li>What performance/precision is required?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of context-free meta questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Am I asking too many questions?</li>
  <li>Do my questions seem relevant?</li>
  <li>Are you the right person to answer these questions?</li>
  <li>Are your answers requirements?</li>
  <li>Can I ask more questions later?</li>
  <li>Would you be willing to participate in a requirements review?</li>
  <li>Is there anything else I should be asking you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of non-context-free questions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Leading questions: &quot;You need a larger screen, don't you?&quot;</li>
  <li>Self answering questions: &quot;Are fifty items about right?&quot;</li>
  <li>Controlling statements: &quot;Can we get back to my questions?&quot;</li>
  <li>Too long and too complex: &quot;I have a three part question, ...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>When you formulate a set of questions, you also should consider the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't ask people to describe things they don't usually describe.</li>
  <li>Don't ask questions that assume that users can describe complex
    activities. Example: tying your shoelace.</li>
  <li>In general, people can do many things they cannot describe.</li>
  <li>Empirical evidence &#151; poor correlation.</li>
  <li>Ask open-ended questions.</li>
  <li>Avoid questions that begin with &quot;Why?&quot;, since such questions can 
    provoke a defensive posture.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you conduct an interview session, remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't expect simple answers.</li>
  <li>Don't rush the interviewee for answers.</li>
  <li>Listen, listen, listen!</li>
</ul>
