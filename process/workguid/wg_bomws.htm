<h2 class="banner">Guideline: <rpw name="PresentationName">Business Analysis Modeling 
  Workshop</rpw></h2>
<p>This workshop focuses on finding business workers and business entities that
participate in one business use-case realization. A productive way of working is to
gather a group of 3-7 people, use a whiteboard, easel, and Post-it<font size="1">?</font>
Notes. As the workshop progresses, your results should fill the walls of the
room, making sure that everyone can see and compare the different types of
diagrams that will show different aspects of the realization of a business
process. These diagrams are here presented in a sequence you would introduce
them, but once introduced they will evolve in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Study the workflow of a business use-case. Mark each section in your text to show
responsibilities that would fit on one business worker or business entity. Or,
if you have drawn an activity diagram for the workflow, mark up activity states
in the diagram. Use
two colors of Post-it<font size="1">?</font> Notes: one for business workers,
and one for entities.</p>
<p>Create a new activity diagram, with one swimlane for each business worker
that you a this point know is participating. Discuss how activities are divided
among the participating business workers - some activities may need to be split,
some could be merged.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../modguide/images/md_bact8.gif" width="547" height="403"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Example of activity diagram with swimlanes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you understand what responsibilities each business worker has, you may
start to add the business entities into the picture using object flows in the
activity diagrams. However, to avoid clutter you often need to limit the
business entities you show to those that are primary to the workflow. For
details of business entities class diagrams are a better choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../modguide/images/md_bact10.gif" width="608" height="612"></p>
<p class="picturetext">Example of an activity diagram with object flows
added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize your results, you can create class diagram that shows the
business workers and the primary business entities. In this class diagram, you
can also start to add the relationships between business workers and business entities
that are necessary to perform the workflow of the business use-case realization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the number of business workers and business entities is large, you may
need several diagrams. The following is recommended:
<ul>
  <li>One diagram that shows how the business workers interact (without showing
    any business entities).</li>
  <li>A diagram for each subflow of the business use-case realization. Each of
    these diagrams should contain just the business workers and business
    entities involved in the subflow. You could even limit the diagram by
    showing only the most interesting business entities.</li>
</ul>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="../modguide/images/bcoldm1.gif" width="426" height="308"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A class diagram shows how business workers
and business entities are related to perform a business use-case realization
workflow.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, it can be useful to in a separate class diagram keep
track of the business entities on how they need to be related.&nbsp;<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../modguide/images/bent2.gif" width="325" height="60"><p class="picturetext">A
class diagram showing the business entities and their relationships.&nbsp;
<p>Sequence diagrams, which are often more descriptive than activity diagrams, are good for describing the workflow in the following situations:
<ul>
  <li>When parts of the business use-case realization are complex or unclear.</li>
  <li>When there are few business workers and business entities involved, but
    many operations to perform.</li>
  <li>When it is important to show the exact sequence in a workflow, that is, of
    messages for operations by business workers and messages to operations of
    business entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the number of business workers and business entities is large, you may
need several sequence diagrams. Our recommendations for collaboration diagrams
are also valid for sequence diagrams. Start with the use-case realization?s
normal workflow, following its structure. Continue with alternative subflows.</p>
<p>To draw a sequence diagram of a business use-case realization, do the
following:
<ul>
  <li>Put all business workers and business entities that participate in the
    workflow into a sequence diagram.</li>
  <li>Describe how the business workers interact via messages. For each message,
    specify the operation it concerns. If a business worker handles a business
    entity, specify the operation it concerns.</li>
  <li>In the text margin, describe each activation (message requesting an
    operation).</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="../modguide/images/bseqdm1.gif" width="327" height="286"></p>
<p class="picturetext">A sequence diagram documents how business workers
interact and handle business entities to perform the workflow of a business
use-case realization.</p>
<p>When you are ready, save the information about each business worker and
business entity (which activities it is supposed to perform). You will describe
them later. Also save the information about the business use case and its
realization, by copying the contents of the whiteboard. A great way of copying
is to take a picture of the whiteboard with a Polaroid<font size="1">?</font>
or digital camera - a digital picture has the advantage of being possible to
share digitally on a project home page.<br>
